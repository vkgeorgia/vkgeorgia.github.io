- The need to **reduce costs or optimize a business unit** without breaking critical capabilities.
- Growing concern about **risk** — legacy systems, fragmented architecture, regulatory exposure, or AI-related uncertainty.

In these moments, speed matters — but **clarity matters more**, because wrong decisions become expensive.
