## AI Consulting Approach

I help organizations:
1. **Identify AI opportunities** in existing business processes
2. **Design AI-ready architectures** that enable automation
3. **Develop POCs** to demonstrate value before full implementation
4. **Specify AI agent requirements** for development teams
5. **Integrate AI** with existing enterprise systems

My approach combines **enterprise architecture expertise** with **practical AI implementation**, ensuring that AI solutions deliver measurable business value while being technically sound and scalable.
