## Project: BTCL-ARCO (1) – Digital Business Transformation

**Industry:** Telecom
**Employer:** EPAM
**Client:** BTC
**Project Code:** BTCL-ARCO (1)
**Start Date:** May 2023
**End Date:** Sept 2023
**Role(s):** Enterprise Architect
**Key Result:** BTC prepared its business transformation from a traditional telecom to a digital service marketplace; a target-state information architecture was prepared as a foundation for future changes, providing the client with a clear plan for system and information transformation.

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal
To deliver a comprehensive, target-state Information Architecture and a clear transformation roadmap for BTC by September 2023, enabling its evolution into a digital service marketplace supporting new digital industries (eHealth, FinTech, Cloud) and clarifying future business functions and data interactions.

### Situation
BTC, a telecom company, was undergoing a digital transformation to evolve from a traditional mobile operator into a digital service marketplace. Competitive pressure intensified the urgency to adapt, as rivals had already started offering digital services beyond core telecom offerings. BTC was expanding into new digital industries (eHealth, FinTech, Cloud) and needed a minimal viable architecture (MVA) and information architecture vision.

### Task
As an Enterprise Architect, I was tasked with analyzing the current state of the company's information architecture and designing a target-state model that would support the new business strategy. Analyze the current state and define target information architecture and roadmap.

### Actions
I undertook the following actions in my role as Enterprise Architect over a period of 5 months (from May 2023 to September 2023):
* Conducted a landscape assessment, studying how the client's business was structured.
* Designed the target information architecture, organizing and streamlining their key information entities.
* Created customer journeys and capability maps to visualize business processes and required capabilities.
* Developed a target-state information model — the Information Architecture — showing how data entities would be structured and related in the future state of the business.
* Proposed a clear change roadmap for phased transformation to achieve the target state.

### Result
The client received:
* **A Clear Plan for Transforming the Information Architecture:** The client received a comprehensive Information Architecture for the enterprise’s future state. This clarified how their business would function, what information entities would be involved, and how they would interact — paving the way for system and data-level transformation.
* **Foundation for Future Digital Services:** An architectural basis was created that will enable BTC to successfully develop as a provider of digital services in new industries (eHealth, FinTech, Cloud).
