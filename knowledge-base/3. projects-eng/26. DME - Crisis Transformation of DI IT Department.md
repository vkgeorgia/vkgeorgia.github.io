# Crisis pivot of an internal IT unit toward external clients (DME-26)

## Context
During the COVID-19 shock, the aviation industry faced severe demand pressure. Domodedovo Integration (DI) historically served the airport as an internal client, and its sustainability was threatened when the core business entered crisis mode.

## The Decision Challenge
The central decision was whether DI should be protected as a cost center awaiting recovery or repositioned as a revenue-generating unit serving external clients. The risk of delay was existential for the unit; the risk of rushing was to offer immature products that could damage reputation and consume scarce capacity.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Time was constrained, and internal teams were under stress. Turning internal capabilities into market offerings required selecting what could be credibly packaged, what needed adaptation, and what should be dropped. A realistic go-to-market approach had to balance ambition with the organization’s delivery capacity.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The effort focused on identifying transferable capabilities, defining minimal product boundaries, and clarifying value propositions and operating assumptions. The aim was to create a coherent external-facing portfolio rather than a list of “things the IT unit has”.

## Outcome and Impact
DI’s work was reoriented toward external clients, opening new revenue streams and supporting enterprise sustainability during the crisis. The contribution was formally recognized by management.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
Crisis pivots work when the organization reduces choices quickly: not every internal asset is a product, and the fastest route to sustainability is a small set of defensible offerings.
