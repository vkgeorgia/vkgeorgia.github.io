## Project: GAM-VTB – Omnichannel Communications

**Industry:** Finance
**Domain:** Communications
**Employer:** Gamma
**Client:** VTB Pension Fund
**Project Code:** GAM-VTB
**Start Date:** Dec 2015
**End Date:** Jul 2018
**Role(s):** Business Analyst, Project Manager
**Key Result:** The system successfully sent hundreds of thousands of messages per week, reduced message preparation time by 10 times, and enabled event-based mailings to be completed in one day, significantly enhancing communication efficiency and quality.

### Situation
VTB Pension Fund faced significant challenges in managing client communications. Their existing mailing system was inefficient and unsystematic, making it impossible to correctly and timely send out large volumes of information. There was no unified mailing list, client segmentation, or defined communication scenarios, leading to the team being "confused" by processes and operating without a clear strategy. This hindered accurate and timely client updates regarding their personal accounts and related events.

### Task
In my dual role as Business Analyst and Project Manager, my task was to develop and implement an integrated solution for an omnichannel communication system. The objective was to ensure the ability to timely and accurately inform clients about their account status and related events. This required creating a system supporting omnichannel communication using the client's Personal Account, email, and SMS, while maintaining a consistent communication style and strategy.

### Actions
I undertook the following actions over a period of 2 years and 7 months (from December 2015 to July 2018, including subsequent system enhancements):
* **Project Organization and Planning:** I initiated and structured the project, defining its scope and objectives.
* **Stakeholder Identification and Engagement:** I identified all key project stakeholders within VTB Pension Fund and actively engaged with them throughout the entire process.
* **Requirements Gathering and Analysis:** In my role as Business Analyst, I delved deeply into the business needs, gathering and analyzing stakeholder requirements while considering all existing business rules and constraints (both technical and legal).
* **Software Development Process Management:** I organized the entire software development process, built the development team, and oversaw their work, ensuring that the developed solution met requirements and quality standards. The development utilized Web, PHP, and C# technologies.
* **Oversight of Development and Implementation Accuracy:** I maintained continuous oversight of the development progress and the correct implementation of the system.
* **Project Delivery and Acceptance:** I successfully presented and delivered the project to the client, receiving formal commendation for the work completed.

### Result
As a result of my work:
* **A Robust and Scalable Omnichannel Communication System was Implemented:** The system was successfully deployed and began processing hundreds of thousands of messages per week.
* **Significant Reduction in Message Preparation Time:** The time required to prepare messages for distribution was reduced tenfold.
* **Accelerated Event-Based Mailings:** Information dissemination for a single event, which previously took up to two weeks, is now completed within one day.
* **High Quality and Reliability of Mailings:** Messages are now sent without errors and without blocking by mail services.
* **Unified Communication Strategy:** The client's team learned to use templates and established a systematic approach to client communication across three key channels (Personal Account, Email, SMS) with a consistent style and strategy.
* **High Client Satisfaction:** The client expressed deep satisfaction with the ability to effectively and consistently inform clients, leading to increased client loyalty and satisfaction.
