## Project: DANF-L2C – Business Transformation

**Industry:** Manufacturing
**Domain:** Business Transformation, Subscription Management
**Employer:** EPAM
**Client:** Danfoss
**Project Code:** DANF-L2C
**Start Date:** Mar 2024
**End Date:** Jun 2024
**Role(s):** Enterprise Architect
**Key Result:** A comprehensive solution blueprint and capability map were delivered, providing the client with a clear roadmap for implementing a subscription management solution that aligns with business objectives and technological capabilities.

### Situation
Danfoss, a major manufacturing company, made the strategic decision to transition from a pure equipment manufacturing business to a service-based business. They needed to design a subscription management solution that would connect the order-to-quote flow, acting as an intermediary between CRM and ERP systems. This required a thorough analysis and design phase to ensure the solution met business needs and integrated seamlessly with existing systems.

### Task
In my role as an Enterprise Architect, I was tasked with conducting an analysis and design stage to define and blueprint a subscription management solution. The goal was to gather requirements, develop a comprehensive blueprint, and create a prioritized implementation roadmap.

### Actions
I undertook the following actions over a period of 4 months (from March 2024 to June 2024):
* **Landscape Survey:** I surveyed the enterprise landscape to gather requirements, business rules, and constraints for the future solution.
* **Stakeholder Engagement:** I conducted interviews and workshops with stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations.
* **Capability Mapping:** I developed an enterprise's capability map in both its current and future states.
* **Full-Scale Blueprint:** I prepared a full-scale blueprint for the future state of the subscription solution.
* **Prioritized Roadmap:** I created a prioritized backlog and roadmap for implementing the solution.
* **Vendor Selection Framework:** I developed a detailed framework for selecting a solution provider.
* **Development Participation:** I actively participated in the development of the solution.

### Result
As a result of my work:
* **Streamlined and Prioritized Requirements:** I organized and prioritized the solution requirements, enabling the selection of the right supplier and facilitating the transition to the development stage.
* **Clear and Comprehensive Roadmap:** We provided the client with a clear and comprehensive roadmap for implementing the subscription management solution, ensuring alignment with business objectives and technological capabilities.
* **Actionable Blueprint and Capability Map:** A full-scale blueprint and capability map were delivered that guided the development process and supported effective decision-making.
