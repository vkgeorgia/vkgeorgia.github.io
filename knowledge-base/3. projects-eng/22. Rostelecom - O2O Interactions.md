# Simplifying inter-operator settlement accounting under complex offsets (RTK-O2O)

## Context
Rostelecom’s interactions with other operators involved complex multi-party service supply and debt offset schemes. Settlement reconciliation was slow, error-prone, and paper-heavy, consuming significant operational effort and delaying the availability of funds.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision challenge was how to simplify settlements without losing correctness: whether to continue with incremental process improvements or to introduce a more structured settlement registration and reconciliation model. Errors at this layer are expensive—financially and in partner relationships—so “speed” without control would be a false win.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Multiple counterparties and non-trivial offset rules create edge cases that are difficult to resolve manually. Formalizing the model improves accuracy and reduces effort, but it requires agreement across internal stakeholders and partners. Exploring alternative technology (a distributed ledger POC) could increase transparency but introduces adoption and governance complexity.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work focused on making settlement events and obligations explicit: standard representations, controlled reconciliation steps, and clear responsibility boundaries. The alternative approach using distributed registration was explored as a way to reduce disputes and improve traceability, with attention to where such an approach would be justified.

## Outcome and Impact
A concept and agreed direction for inter-operator interaction architecture were established, with a documented solution ready for implementation. The expected benefits included thousands of man-hours saved per year and significant error-driven loss avoidance.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
Multi-party settlements improve when reconciliation is treated as a shared model—with explicit events, obligations, and traceability across parties—rather than as endless exception handling.
