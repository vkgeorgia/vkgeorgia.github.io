# Data lake presale and solution defense for an oil & gas enterprise (RTK-LAKE)

## Context
Gazprom Neft needed to work with large, heterogeneous datasets across fuel supply and sales and related products. Existing approaches struggled with scale and variety, limiting the organization’s ability to extract insights and identify new profit opportunities.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision challenge was to frame a “data lake” not as a technology trend but as a coherent capability with clear business cases, costs, and implementation risks. Presale success depended on translating data ambitions into a defendable architecture and a credible delivery path under competitive scrutiny.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Large data initiatives fail when they promise universal value without prioritization. The proposal needed to balance platform generality with concrete use cases and to set expectations around governance, data onboarding effort, and time-to-value. Competitive tender conditions raised the bar for clarity and justification.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The solution was structured around sources, ingestion patterns, storage and processing responsibilities, and consumption paths for analytics. Emphasis was placed on explaining how the platform would be governed and how it would enable business units to move from data capture to repeatable insight generation.

## Outcome and Impact
Customer requirements were analyzed, a competitive solution concept and proposal were prepared and presented, and the solution was successfully defended in a tender process. The presale work established a strong basis for subsequent implementation discussions.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
In presale for data platforms, credibility comes from acknowledging constraints up front—especially governance and onboarding effort—and showing how value emerges in stages rather than all at once.
