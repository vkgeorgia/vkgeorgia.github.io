# Core retail platform roadmap under M&A-driven complexity (DELB-CRP)

## Context
Ahold Delhaize underwent multiple transformations and acquisitions, creating a complex retail and IT landscape with duplicated functions and unclear platform ownership. Omnichannel growth depended on deciding what to standardize and what to allow to remain local.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision challenge was how to define a core retail platform direction that optimizes investment without stalling delivery. Choosing “one platform for everything” can be unrealistic in post-merger environments; choosing to keep everything local preserves duplication and cost.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Different banners and regions often have legitimate differences, but duplicated capabilities create ongoing spend and inconsistent customer experience. A roadmap had to be credible: specific enough to drive choices, but flexible enough to account for organizational realities and sequencing constraints.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work centered on discovery and capability-based reasoning: mapping application functions to business capabilities to identify overlaps, gaps, and opportunities for consolidation. The roadmap was structured to support incremental convergence—reducing duplication while maintaining delivery momentum.

## Outcome and Impact
A strategic roadmap for the core retail platform was established, enabling more informed decisions about which systems to retain, rationalize, or replace. The client gained a clearer basis for avoiding functional duplication and optimizing investments.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
In post-M&A landscapes, roadmaps matter because they make trade-offs explicit so stakeholders can align on what will converge, when, and why.
