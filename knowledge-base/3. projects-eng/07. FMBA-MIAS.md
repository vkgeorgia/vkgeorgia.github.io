## Project: FMBA-MIAS – Medical Information and Analytical System (MIAS)

**Industry:** Healthcare
**Employer:** FMBA of Russia
**Client:** The Federal Medical-Biological Agency (FMBA of Russia)
**Project Code:** FMBA-MIAS
**Start Date:** Mar 2012
**End Date:** Sept 2015
**Role(s):** Project Manager
**Key Result:** Delivered a medical analytics system for FMBA to forecast athletes' performance and support training plans based on health assessments.

### Situation
The Federal Medical-Biological Agency (FMBA of Russia) likely faced the challenge of lacking a centralized and efficient tool for collecting, analyzing, and utilizing athletes' medical data. This hindered accurate forecasting of their athletic performance, optimization of training plans, and identification of potential health risks based on a comprehensive assessment of their physical condition. The absence of such a system limited the possibilities for a scientifically sound approach to athlete preparation.

### Task
In my role as Project Manager, my task was to develop and implement a Medical Information and Analytical System (MIAS) for the FMBA. The goal was to create a platform that would enable the forecasting of athletes' performance and support their training plans based on a comprehensive health assessment, ensuring the collection, storage, and analysis of medical data.

### Actions
To achieve these goals, I undertook the following actions over a period of 3 years and 7 months (from March 2012 to September 2015):
* **Requirements Gathering and Analysis:** I thoroughly collected and analyzed FMBA's requirements for the system, covering medical data, athlete performance indicators, forecasting algorithms, and reporting needs.
* **System Design:** I led the design of the MIAS architecture, defining the database structure, the logic of analytical modules, and user interfaces. Mongo DB, Ruby, and Rabbit MQ technologies were utilized.
* **Project and Team Management:** As Project Manager, I was responsible for all aspects of project management: planning, task allocation, risk management, timeline, and budget control. I led the team of developers and other specialists throughout all stages of the project lifecycle.
* **Development and Implementation Oversight:** I ensured that the developed system complied with technical specifications and quality requirements, and I managed its implementation process.
* **Data Integration:** I oversaw the integration of the system with various medical data sources to form a comprehensive picture of athletes' health.
* **Analytical Module Development:** I supervised the creation and testing of analytical modules capable of processing medical data and generating performance forecasts.
* **Training and Support:** I organized training for medical personnel and coaches on how to use the new system and provided necessary technical support.

### Result
As a result of my work:
* **A Medical Information and Analytical System (MIAS) was Implemented:** The FMBA gained a powerful tool for working with athletes' medical data.
* **Athlete Performance Forecasting Capability was Realized:** The system enables the forecasting of athletes' future performance based on a comprehensive analysis of their health.
* **Training Plan Support was Provided:** Coaches gained access to data and analytical tools for more accurate adjustments and optimization of training plans.
* **Health Assessment Efficiency Improved:** FMBA can now conduct more in-depth and systematic assessments of athletes' health.
* **Scientific and Methodological Support Enhanced:** The system contributes to a more scientifically grounded and personalized approach to athlete preparation, potentially leading to improved results and reduced health risks.
