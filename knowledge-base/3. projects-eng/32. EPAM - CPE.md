# Centralized permission model for mixed user populations (EPM-PSR)

## Context
EPAM operated many internal and external systems used by employees and non-employees (students, subcontractors, partners). Access control was decentralized, handled separately by each system and process, increasing cost and the risk of inconsistent or excessive access.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision was whether to keep permissions embedded in each system or move to a centralized model that enforces consistent rules across the landscape. Centralization can reduce risk and effort, but it concentrates responsibility and requires careful definition of roles, resources, and ownership.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
The solution needed to support both role-based and resource-based access patterns, reflecting how real organizations operate. Increased flexibility improves fit but can create configuration complexity; simplicity improves operability but risks forcing exceptions back into application-specific logic.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work focused on defining a permission contract that systems can rely on: clear identity inputs, consistent policy evaluation, and governance over rule changes. The aim was to reduce unauthorized access risk by making permission decisions explicit and centrally auditable.

## Outcome and Impact
A concept for a centralized permission engine was established, enabling both role-based and resource-based assignment patterns. The organization gained a foundation for reducing access management labor and strengthening control over sensitive information and systems.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
Access management improves when permissions are treated as a shared enterprise capability—with explicit governance—rather than as scattered implementations hidden inside applications.
