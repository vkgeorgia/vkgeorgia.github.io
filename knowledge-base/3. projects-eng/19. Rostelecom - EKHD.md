# Post-launch audit and recovery plan for corporate data storage (RTK-EKHD)

## Context
Rostelecom had launched a unified corporate data storage system (EKHD) and then encountered visible operational shortcomings: unclear sources, incorrect processing, disorder in storage practices, and missed SLAs. The investment was at risk of becoming a cost center rather than a decision-support foundation.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision challenge was whether to continue investing in a system that was not meeting expectations, and if so, what to change first: technology, data governance, operating processes, or all of the above. Misdiagnosis would either lead to further sunk cost or to superficial fixes that do not restore trust in data.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
The system was already in production, so remediation had to preserve continuity for business users. Improvements needed to address both technical and organizational causes, and sequencing mattered: tightening governance without fixing broken pipelines creates frustration; changing technology without clarifying ownership recreates the same disorder on a new platform.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The audit linked observed problems to an explicit model of sources, flows, storage zones, and ownership responsibilities. Recommendations treated data as a lifecycle-managed asset: clear onboarding rules, controlled transformations, SLA-backed delivery processes, and governance that makes accountability visible.

## Outcome and Impact
The assessment enabled the organization to correct a costly initiative and restore value. Storage costs were reduced by 15%, report preparation time decreased by 4–5×, and the platform became a more reliable basis for management decisions and marketing operations.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
Large data platforms fail when accountability is diffuse. Recovery starts when the organization can point to specific ownership and lifecycle rules—not just to “better technology.”
