## Project: RTK-EKHD – DWH Audit (EKHD)

**Industry:** Telecom
**Domain:** Business Intelligence, Data Management
**Employer:** Rostelecom
**Client:** Rostelecom
**Project Code:** RTK-EKHD
**Start Date:** Mar 2018
**End Date:** Dec 2018
**Role(s):** Enterprise Architect
**Key Result:** A comprehensive analysis of the implementation of the Unified Corporate Data Storage System was conducted, and recommendations for its improvement were provided.

### Situation
Rostelecom had implemented the Unified Corporate Data Storage System (EKHD). After implementation and launch, the system's shortcomings became clearly visible: confusion in data sources, incorrect data processing, a lack of order in storage, non-compliance with data delivery SLAs, and other issues that impacted the business and raised questions about the effectiveness of the investment.

### Task
My task as an Enterprise Architect was to audit the system itself, the surrounding enterprise landscape, interview stakeholders, and interview the system's creators, including subcontractors. I needed to understand why the system was not working as intended and how to fix it.

### Actions
I undertook the following actions over a period of 9 months (from March to December 2018):
* **Conducted Interviews:** I held a series of interviews with stakeholders, developers, and subcontractors to gather information about the system's operation.
* **Architectural Analysis:** I created an architectural diagram and system model, linking all the problems I had identified to it.
* **Developed an Improvement Plan:** I developed a plan of fixes and improvements that could be undertaken to rectify the situation.
* **Comprehensive Recommendations:** The plan included both technical changes related to storage technologies and organizational changes related to a review and reorganization of data acquisition processes, data management, and data lifecycle management.

### Result
As a result of my work:
* **The Project Was Salvaged:** The company was given the opportunity to correct a costly project, which then began to provide value.
* **Data Storage Costs Reduced:** Data storage costs were reduced by 15%.
* **Improved Data Management:** There was more order in data management.
* **Report Preparation Time Reduced:** The time to prepare reports for management purposes was reduced by 4-5 times.
* **Foundation for Decision-Making:** The system became the basis for management decisions for marketing operations.
* **Numerous Indirect Effects:** Many indirect effects were achieved, such as a reduction in accounts receivable, savings in time and labor on client and partner notifications, and more.
