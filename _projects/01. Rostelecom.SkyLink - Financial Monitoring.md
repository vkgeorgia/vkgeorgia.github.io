# Internal budgeting and financial control

## Context
Rostelecom.SkyLink relied on budgeting and internal financial control processes that were slow and opaque. Budget preparation could take up to six months, which limited the organization’s ability to respond to change and reduced confidence in management reporting.

## The Decision Challenge
The central question was whether budgeting should remain a periodic administrative exercise or become a management control loop supported by consistent data and rules. Getting it wrong risked locking the company into long planning cycles, weak cost discipline, and decisions driven by incomplete or late information.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
The work had to reconcile different expectations across finance and management while keeping day-to-day operations running. Standardization improved comparability and control, but it reduced local flexibility and forced explicit choices about definitions, approval flows, and reporting granularity.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The problem was framed as an end-to-end decision system: how plans are created, approved, monitored, and corrected. That required a shared information model for budget items and financial facts, clear ownership of rules, and a consistent path from operational inputs to management views. The emphasis was on making the logic auditable and repeatable rather than relying on individual expertise and manual reconciliation.

## Outcome and Impact
Budget preparation time was reduced from six months to two months. Financial transparency improved, enabling more reliable monitoring of financial flows and stronger internal control without increasing the manual reporting burden.

## Lessons Learned
This case illustrates that “automation” only matters after the organization agrees on what it wants to control and why; clarity of definitions and decision rights is what makes speed and transparency sustainable.
