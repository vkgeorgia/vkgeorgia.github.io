# Authorization cockpit planning under MVP time pressure

## Context
Danfoss needed a new authorization management application for users and partners, with an MVP expected within the year. The initiative required clarity on scope, priorities, and how the solution fits the broader identity and access landscape.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision challenge was to define an MVP that is meaningful and safe: enough capability to support partner authorization needs, but not so much that it becomes a multi-year program. Vendor choice also depended on an explicit view of required capabilities and the organization’s constraints.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Time-to-MVP limited how much could be built or standardized in the first iteration. Reuse of existing UI components reduced delivery risk but constrained design flexibility. Centralization improves governance, but it increases dependency on shared services and decision-making speed.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work focused on capability-based reasoning: what authorization decisions must be supported, what context is required, and how policy governance should work over time. A prioritized backlog and roadmap were used to make trade-offs explicit for both vendor selection and internal planning.

## Outcome and Impact
A capability map, prioritized scope, and implementation roadmap were established, supporting a cost-effective vendor selection and enabling the transition from uncertainty to a controlled build plan.

## Lessons Learned
Identity initiatives fail when MVP scope is defined by features; they succeed when MVP is defined by the minimum decision set the organization must control safely.
