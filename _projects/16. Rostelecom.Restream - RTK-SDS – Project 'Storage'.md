# Enterprise storage option selection under mixed data needs (RTK-SDS)

## Context
Rostelecom.Restream worked with growing data volumes and a mix of structured and unstructured datasets. Different departments had different views on storage and processing needs, which created fragmentation risk and made “one-size-fits-all” decisions hard to justify.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision was how to select an enterprise storage direction that balanced reliability, accessibility, and performance without overpaying or locking the organization into a mismatched approach. The risk of getting it wrong was both financial (unjustified spend) and operational (slow processing, reduced availability, inconsistent practices across teams).

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Data types had different lifecycles and access patterns, which implied different storage strategies. Centralization improves governance and efficiency, but it can reduce team autonomy if it forces a single model onto all workloads. The selection needed to remain explainable to an architectural committee and actionable for implementation.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work organized the problem around data categories and lifecycles, then translated those into requirements and constraints for storage capabilities. Options were evaluated by explicitly comparing advantages and disadvantages, focusing on controllability and fit rather than claiming a universally “best” choice.

## Outcome and Impact
Balanced storage options were presented with clear trade-offs, enabling a defensible selection. The organization improved expectations around reliability and availability and avoided unjustified costs by aligning storage choices with actual data lifecycles.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
Storage decisions are rarely about capacity; they are about making lifecycle assumptions explicit so that the organization can govern data consistently as volumes and use cases evolve.
