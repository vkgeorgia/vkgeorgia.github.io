# Architecture audit and standards-aligned documentation for PSMS software (GAM-NAMOS)

## Context
Wincor Nixdorf had an operational petrol station management system in the field, but the architectural knowledge and documentation were not sufficiently current or standardized. This created support and evolution risk and complicated alignment with local and European expectations for documentation quality.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision was whether to treat documentation as a compliance artifact or as a control mechanism that reduces operational and delivery risk. In mature, already-running software, gaps in architectural understanding translate into slower incident resolution, fragile integrations, and costly change.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
The work had to describe an existing reality rather than a greenfield design. Over-documentation would be expensive and quickly stale; under-documentation would fail to support compliance and change. The emphasis needed to be on system boundaries, responsibilities, integrations, and operational characteristics.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The audit focused on making implicit decisions explicit: how the system is decomposed, where data moves, and where constraints and risks accumulate. Documentation was structured to support both engineering work (change planning, integration safety) and organizational needs (common vocabulary, repeatable reviews, standards alignment).

## Outcome and Impact
An architectural audit clarified the current state and risks of the PSMS software, and a complete documentation set was established in a standards-aligned form. As a result, the system became easier to support and evolve, and the organization reduced the risk associated with undocumented dependencies.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
In long-lived systems, documentation is not a narrative of work—it is a mechanism for preserving decision intent so that future change does not turn into accidental redesign.
