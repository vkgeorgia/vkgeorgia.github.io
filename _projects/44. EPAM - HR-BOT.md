# HR self-service assistant to reduce response time and operational load (HR-BOT)

## Context
EPAM operated at a scale of 68,000 employees and faced high volume of routine HR inquiries across 12 processes. Human-operated response times often stretched into several days, reducing employee satisfaction and limiting HR capacity for higher-value work.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision challenge was how to introduce an automated assistant that improves speed and consistency without creating new risk through incorrect guidance or poor escalation handling. A low-quality assistant would increase support load and erode trust; a conservative design would fail to reduce operational burden.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
HR processes include policy nuance and exceptions, so automation had to be bounded by a clear escalation model. Higher automation rates require a disciplined knowledge base and feedback loop; faster rollout increases the risk of inconsistent answers. Scaling from an initial user base to the full organization required stability and predictable operations.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work treated the assistant as part of the HR service operating model: knowledge-driven resolution for routine cases, controlled escalation to human experts, and measurable quality signals to guide continuous improvement. The focus was on decision safety and operational governance rather than on a “chatbot feature set.”

## Outcome and Impact
The assistant served 35,000 employees and continued expanding toward full coverage. Response times dropped from days to minutes, 80% of inquiries were resolved without human intervention, and answer accuracy reached 99%, saving thousands of man-hours per year and reducing operational load on HR.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
Service automation succeeds when the organization treats it as a governance problem—clear boundaries, measurable quality, and a reliable escalation path—rather than as a conversational interface.
