# Unified contact profile concept for enterprise-wide consistency (EPM-SPC)

## Context
EPAM maintained multiple systems that stored information about employees and other contact types (students, interns, community members). Fragmentation created discrepancies, confusion in processes, and barriers to unification and consistent management.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision was whether to keep “profiles” as system-specific representations or establish a shared enterprise concept that can be reused across processes and systems. A weak concept would add another layer of inconsistency; an overly rigid one would block real-world use cases and slow adoption.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Different contact types have different lifecycles and sensitivity levels, which complicates a single model. Unification improves consistency and reduces rework, but it requires explicit transformation rules and agreement on what is core versus what remains contextual. The concept also needed to be usable as a foundation for subsequent initiatives.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work defined a shared information architecture for contact profiles and clarified process-level responsibilities for creating, updating, and consuming profiles. The emphasis was on explicit data flows and transformation rules so downstream systems can integrate without re-deriving identity and profile semantics.

## Outcome and Impact
A unified profile concept was established and became the foundation for multiple follow-up initiatives (including centralized permission management and profile storage), reducing duplication and supporting more consistent processes and data management across the organization.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
A “single profile” is only valuable when it is a contract: a shared definition that reduces argument and rework every time a new system or process needs identity data.
