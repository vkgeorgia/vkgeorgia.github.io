# Consolidated accounting and inventory across legal entities

## Context
Rostelecom.SkyLink operated through multiple legal entities with fragmented accounting and inventory practices. Disparate data made consolidated reporting slow and unreliable and weakened integration with planning and control functions.

## The Decision Challenge
The core decision was how far to push unification: whether to accept “local truth” in each entity and stitch reports together later, or to enforce shared definitions and workflows so that consolidation becomes routine. A poor choice would either stall adoption (if overly rigid) or preserve the same transparency problems under a new label (if overly permissive).

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Unification required aligning accounting policies and inventory rules while respecting legal-entity differences. Faster rollout favored minimal change, but long-term transparency depended on disciplined data standards and consistent operating procedures. Integration with existing planning processes added pressure to define stable interfaces and ownership.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work treated accounting and inventory as enterprise data products: a single set of definitions, controlled master data, and predictable aggregation paths to consolidated views. The emphasis was on reducing reconciliation surfaces—fewer handoffs, fewer transformations, and fewer “special cases” that only exist in spreadsheets.

## Outcome and Impact
Accounting and inventory management were unified across legal entities, enabling transparent consolidated reporting and making integration with planning systems feasible. Operational effort shifted away from manual consolidation toward routine, repeatable controls.

## Lessons Learned
For multi-entity organizations, the hardest part is not the system choice but agreeing on what “consistent data” means in practice—and being explicit about where differences are legitimate and where they are just inherited noise.
