# Stablecoin proof-of-concept framing under delivery constraints

## Context
A leading bank in Asia explored a national stablecoin concept and needed to validate feasibility through a proof of concept. The engagement required rapid clarity on what a POC can prove, and what it cannot, given surrounding regulatory and operational realities.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision challenge was to define a POC scope that meaningfully reduces uncertainty: demonstrating a coherent operating model and the core system behaviors while avoiding premature commitment to a full-scale architecture. Over-scoping would delay learning; under-scoping would produce a demo with little decision value.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Time constraints demanded prioritization of the most decision-relevant capabilities. A private ledger approach introduces governance questions about issuance, circulation, and control. The solution concept needed to remain adaptable so future regulatory or business decisions can be incorporated without a full redesign.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work focused on requirements and a solution concept that makes responsibilities explicit: how value is issued, how transactions are represented, what constraints matter, and what interfaces and controls are required. A roadmap clarified the sequence from POC learning to implementation decisions.

## Outcome and Impact
A solution concept aligned to requirements and constraints, together with a roadmap for next steps, enabled the client to move from exploration to an implementation initiative.

## Lessons Learned
Financial POCs create value when they turn “is it possible?” into “what decisions must be made next, and what risks do those decisions carry?”—not when they optimize a prototype.
