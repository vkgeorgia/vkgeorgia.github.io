# IT strategy aligned to airport business goals

## Context
Domodedovo Airport needed an IT strategy that supported business growth rather than a set of disconnected departmental plans. Without an integrated view, investment decisions drift toward local optimization and vendor-driven commitments.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision challenge was how to translate enterprise goals into a coherent IT direction that could guide priorities, architecture choices, and vendor selection. The risk of getting it wrong was long-term: expensive technology commitments that do not compound into stronger capabilities.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Strategic work had to align multiple IT subfunctions while remaining understandable to business leadership. Vendor discussions added pressure to make decisions before all uncertainty could be resolved. A strategy needed enough specificity to drive action, but enough flexibility to adapt as business priorities shifted.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work connected business capabilities to enabling technology direction, establishing an enterprise architecture view that made dependencies visible. Vendor and solution selection was treated as a strategic constraint: choices were evaluated by how they supported the target direction, not by feature lists alone.

## Outcome and Impact
A cohesive IT strategy integrated with business goals was established, supported by an enterprise architecture view and selected solution directions. The airport gained a clearer basis for future transformations and investment prioritization.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
IT strategy is most valuable when it narrows choice: it provides a principled way to say “no” to investments that do not strengthen the capabilities the business actually needs.
