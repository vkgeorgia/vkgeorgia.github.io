# Traffic analytics and targeting capability for new revenue streams

## Context
Rostelecom.Restream sought profit growth and considered targeted advertising on owned resources as a viable path. That direction required turning user traffic and interest signals into segments and actionable targeting decisions, not just collecting logs.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision was how to structure a capability that is commercially useful while remaining defensible: segmenting users and inferring interests can create business value, but it also amplifies risks around data quality, explainability, and operational governance. A weak foundation would produce targeting that cannot be trusted and a business model that does not scale.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Multiple analytical steps (identity resolution, segmentation, interest graph) introduce compounding error. Increasing sophistication improves potential uplift but raises operational and reputational risk if the logic is opaque. The system needed to support both business needs (targeting and recommendations) and the organization’s ability to govern and evolve the capability.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work framed the solution as a decision pipeline: from traffic signals to identity to segment membership to targeting actions. The focus was on clear module boundaries, explicit requirements for data inputs/outputs, and traceability—so commercial decisions remain explainable even as models and rules evolve.

## Outcome and Impact
A traffic analysis and targeting system went live, enabling a new targeted advertising business line and supporting recommendation capabilities. The organization gained a scalable foundation for monetizing owned traffic through segmented communication.

## Lessons Learned
Monetization of user data is less about algorithms than about governance: when the organization can explain, control, and iterate the logic safely, revenue becomes repeatable rather than opportunistic.
