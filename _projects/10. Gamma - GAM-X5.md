# Monitoring and predictive maintenance concept for retail climate equipment

## Context
X5 Retail Group faced product losses and elevated electricity costs due to inconsistent temperature control in stores. Equipment failures were handled reactively, with limited ability to plan maintenance or understand systemic drivers of downtime and spoilage.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision was how to structure an investment in monitoring and predictive maintenance so that it produces measurable impact (including a 10% electricity cost reduction target) without creating a solution that stores cannot operate consistently. The risk of choosing poorly was high: either continued losses from downtime/spoilage or a costly initiative with unclear economics.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Retail environments impose practical constraints: diverse store formats, existing equipment heterogeneity, and limited tolerance for operational disruption. Vendor selection and architecture needed to balance speed to rollout against long-term flexibility and data ownership. Predictive capabilities depend on data quality and consistent instrumentation, which are costly to standardize.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work compared credible architectural paths and made the economic logic explicit: what data is needed, where it is captured, how it is governed, and how insights become operational decisions (alerts, maintenance planning, reporting). Options were evaluated as different trade-offs between implementation complexity, controllability, and expected value.

## Outcome and Impact
Two architectural options, a vendor evaluation approach, and a phased roadmap were prepared to support a tender decision. The organization gained a clear basis for selecting a path toward reduced losses, more predictable maintenance, and measurable energy efficiency improvements.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
Predictive maintenance programs are won or lost in the operating model: if stores cannot trust and act on signals consistently, analytics never turns into savings.
