# Profile storage and migration to operationalize unified profiles

## Context
After establishing a unified profile concept, EPAM needed a practical implementation: centralized profile storage that consolidates data from multiple sources and provides reliable access for consuming systems. Without a shared storage capability, the concept would remain theoretical and fragmentation would persist.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision was how to implement profile storage in a way that remains stable while source systems evolve. A one-time migration would not survive dynamic changes in source formats and rules; a more robust approach required explicit operating rules and controlled transformations, increasing initial complexity.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Source systems were changing over time, and profile data required transformation and normalization. Strong consistency improves trust but can slow onboarding of new sources; faster onboarding increases the risk of inconsistent profile semantics. The solution needed to be attractive enough that consuming systems would adopt it rather than building their own copies.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work treated profile storage as a governed data product: defined profile semantics, explicit ingestion and transformation rules, and predictable consumption patterns. Migration planning focused on integrity—verifiable mappings and controlled evolution—so the organization can keep a single profile contract even as sources change.

## Outcome and Impact
A profile storage capability and migration approach were established, enabling consuming systems to integrate around a unified profile source. The organization gained a scalable base for further expansion of profile-driven processes and access control.

## Lessons Learned
Unified profile initiatives fail when migration is treated as “moving data”; they succeed when profile semantics are treated as a living contract with controlled evolution.
