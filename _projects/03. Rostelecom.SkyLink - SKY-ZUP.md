# Unified payroll and HR operating model across branches

## Context
Rostelecom.SkyLink’s distributed branch network relied on non-uniform payroll and HR practices. Differences in accrual logic and incentive schemes created inconsistencies, increased manual checks, and made personnel costs difficult to plan and control.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision was whether to prioritize local autonomy or enterprise consistency in payroll and HR accounting. Fragmentation reduced comparability and increased error risk; strict standardization risked friction where incentive schemes and operational realities differed by branch.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
A unified approach needed to support existing compensation logic while making the rules explicit and auditable. Integration with budgeting meant that HR data could no longer be treated as “back office”; it became an input into financial decisions. Adoption required keeping the experience workable for a broad user base (50+ users) without building exceptions into the core logic.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work focused on defining stable “rules of record” for payroll, incentives, and personnel events, and on connecting those rules to financial planning. The emphasis was on reducing ambiguity through common definitions, consistent approval paths, and predictable outputs for budgeting and reporting.

## Outcome and Impact
A single payroll and motivation system was put in place across branches and connected to the budgeting system, improving transparency of personnel costs and reducing discrepancies in accruals. An HR system went into use for 50+ users, stabilizing day-to-day HR operations.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
When payroll becomes a planning input, consistency is a governance decision—not an IT feature. The “system” succeeds only when the organization is willing to make its compensation logic explicit.
