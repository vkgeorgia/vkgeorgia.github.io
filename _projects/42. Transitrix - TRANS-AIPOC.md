# AI-agent proof-of-concept for product development process automation

## Context
A client’s product development process for launching and evolving confectionery products for the European market was lengthy and unpredictable. The process involved iterative workflows across multiple functions, making it difficult to forecast timelines and manage a product portfolio effectively.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision challenge was whether AI agents could reduce cycle time and increase predictability without turning the process into a fragile automation layer. A poor POC would demonstrate “automation theater” rather than producing credible evidence that the approach can be governed and scaled.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Product development includes complex exceptions and human judgment, limiting how much can be automated safely. Increasing automation improves speed potential but raises risks around correctness, traceability, and stakeholder trust. A POC needed to focus on decision-relevant fragments and make outcomes measurable.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work treated the process as a sequence of decision points and artifacts, identifying where agent-based support can reduce coordination cost and where human judgment must remain primary. The design emphasized traceability and analytics so the organization can observe process state and performance, not just “run bots.”

## Outcome and Impact
A working proof-of-concept demonstrated the practicality of automating selected product development activities with AI agents. The client confirmed potential cycle time reduction (up to 5×) and moved into negotiations for a full-scale implementation.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
Agent-based automation is compelling when it turns a complex process into an observable system—where work state, ownership, and decisions are trackable—rather than simply replacing people with scripts.
