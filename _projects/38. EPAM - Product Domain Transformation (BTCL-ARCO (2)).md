# Product domain restructuring for a digital marketplace direction (BTC-ARCO (2))

## Context
BTC continued its transformation toward a digital services marketplace, but its product domain remained shaped around traditional telecom offerings. The catalog was cluttered, concepts of product and offer were mixed, partner onboarding was not supported, and both configuration and pricing were inflexible.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision challenge was how to redesign the product domain so that it supports marketplace behaviors (partner products, bundling, flexible configuration and pricing) without destabilizing existing operations. A wrong direction would either preserve telecom-era constraints or introduce a complex model the organization could not operate.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
The organization had low domain maturity, and immediate pain required pragmatic near-term improvements alongside a longer-term direction. Flexibility increases model complexity and governance requirements. Partner enablement introduces new responsibilities for onboarding, quality control, and lifecycle management.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work structured the domain around clear concepts and responsibilities and compared solution options through a capability model. The emphasis was on how the organization would reason about products, offers, configurations, bundles, and pricing rules—so that both technology choices and operating processes align with marketplace strategy.

## Outcome and Impact
A product domain concept and a change plan were established, and vendor selection activities for catalog and marketplace solutions were initiated. The organization gained a clearer, strategy-aligned direction for improving product manageability and enabling ecosystem growth.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
Product domain transformations succeed when the organization stops treating the catalog as a list and starts treating it as a model of decisions—where governance and definitions matter as much as systems.
