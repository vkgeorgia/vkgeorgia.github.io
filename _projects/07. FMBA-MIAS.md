# Medical analytics for athlete health assessment and planning (FMBA-MIAS)

## Context
The Federal Medical-Biological Agency needed a more systematic way to collect and use medical data related to athletes’ health assessments. Without a consolidated analytical view, forecasting performance trends and adjusting training plans relied too heavily on fragmented information and individual interpretation.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision was how to turn medical assessments into actionable planning input without overstating certainty. A system that only stores data does not change outcomes; a system that claims predictive power without disciplined assumptions creates false confidence. The challenge was to support informed judgment under medical and performance constraints.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Medical data sources and assessment methods vary, and adoption depends on usability for clinicians and coaches. The solution needed to support analytical insights while maintaining traceability back to assessments. Speed and breadth of data coverage had to be balanced against consistent interpretation and reporting.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work emphasized an information architecture where assessments, indicators, and planning outputs are explicitly related. Analytical components were treated as decision support: transparent inputs, clear outputs, and repeatable reporting rather than opaque “predictions”. Integration of sources was approached as an operating discipline—consistent capture and curation before analytics.

## Outcome and Impact
FMBA gained a medical information and analytical system that supports forecasting and provides structured input into training planning based on health assessments. The organization’s ability to work with athlete medical data became more consistent and repeatable.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
In health-related analytics, the most important outcome is not a forecast—it is a shared, traceable basis for decisions that remain accountable to the underlying assessments.
