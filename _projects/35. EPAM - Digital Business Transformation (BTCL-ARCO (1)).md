# Target-state information architecture for marketplace transformation (BTCL-ARCO (1))

## Context
BTC aimed to evolve from a traditional telecom operator into a digital services marketplace, expanding into adjacent digital domains. Competitive pressure increased the cost of slow transformation, while the existing information landscape was not structured for a multi-domain marketplace model.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision challenge was to define a target information architecture that is ambitious enough to support marketplace growth, yet grounded enough to be actionable. Over-engineering the target state would stall delivery; under-specifying it would lead to inconsistent implementations and escalating integration costs.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Transformation had to coexist with ongoing telecom operations. New digital services introduce new information entities and relationships, and the organization needed a common vocabulary to prevent each domain from inventing incompatible models. A roadmap had to balance sequencing and dependencies across domains rather than assuming a single “big transformation”.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work structured the enterprise around key information entities and their interactions, then connected that model to capabilities and customer journeys. The aim was to provide an architecture that enables consistent decisions across domains: what data is authoritative where, how information flows, and what changes must happen first to unlock later steps.

## Outcome and Impact
A target-state information architecture and transformation roadmap were established, giving BTC a clearer basis for system and data evolution toward a marketplace model and reducing the risk of fragmented domain-specific implementations.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
Marketplace transformations succeed when information architecture is treated as a coordination mechanism across domains—so teams can move quickly without diverging on definitions.
