# EA baseline and transformation roadmap for managed growth

## Context
Rostelecom.Restream was expanding and needed growth to remain manageable rather than accidental. Leadership required a clear view of the current enterprise state and a roadmap that could guide change decisions across processes, systems, and technology.

## The Decision Challenge
The central decision was how to translate a broad ambition (“grow”) into an actionable transformation sequence. Without a shared baseline and target direction, initiatives compete, dependencies become hidden, and change becomes expensive and risky to coordinate.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
The assessment had to balance completeness with usefulness: documenting everything delays decisions, but shallow documentation produces a roadmap that cannot be trusted. Stakeholder perspectives differed across organizational levels, requiring alignment on what matters most for near-term decisions versus long-term evolution.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work structured the enterprise into a baseline view and a target direction, with explicit dependencies and phased steps. The focus was on making trade-offs visible—sequencing, ownership, and implications across business architecture and enabling systems—so leadership could make informed commitments.

## Outcome and Impact
An EA baseline and transformation roadmap were established, providing management with a shared foundation for strategic and organizational decisions and a clearer path for subsequent change implementation.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
Roadmaps become valuable when they shift conversations from “what to build” to “what sequence of decisions reduces risk while keeping the organization able to move.”
