# Omnichannel client notifications under compliance and volume constraints (GAM-VTB)

## Context
VTB Pension Fund needed to communicate with clients reliably and at scale. Communication processes were fragmented: no unified recipient lists, limited segmentation, and inconsistent scenarios, which made timely and accurate notifications difficult.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision was whether to keep operating as a set of ad-hoc mailings or to establish a managed communication capability across channels. The cost of getting it wrong was both operational (missed or late messages at scale) and reputational, especially when clients depend on timely information about their accounts.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Multiple channels introduced compliance, deliverability, and consistency constraints. Higher automation improved speed but required strict governance around templates, approvals, and segmentation rules to prevent errors. The organization needed a process that remained understandable to business owners, not only to IT.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work approached communication as a governed pipeline: audience definition, scenario design, message templating, approvals, and controlled execution across channels. The goal was predictable behavior—traceable rules, repeatable campaigns, and clear ownership—so volume could increase without increasing failure rates.

## Outcome and Impact
The system supported hundreds of thousands of messages per week. Message preparation time decreased tenfold, and event-based mailings that previously took up to two weeks were completed in one day, improving communication quality and reducing process confusion.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
At scale, “messaging” is not content production; it is a decision system where governance, segmentation rules, and operational discipline determine whether automation is safe.
