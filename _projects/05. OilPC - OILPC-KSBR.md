# Corporate cashless fuel payments with fraud reduction

## Context
Gazprom Neft managed cashless fuel payments for a very large base of corporate customers (70,000+ legal entities). Paper fuel coupons and manual reconciliation created operational drag and opened space for fraud, producing direct losses and slow settlement cycles.

## The Decision Challenge
The core decision was whether to keep improving controls around a paper-based model or to move the settlement mechanism onto an instrument that supports traceability and enforceable rules. A wrong choice risked continued fraud exposure and an ever-growing reconciliation effort that would not scale with the customer base.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
A change in payment instrument affected security, customer experience, and operational processes (issuance, blocking, accounting, dispute handling). Anti-fraud measures had to improve materially without turning the solution into a high-friction process for legitimate customers. Scale meant that edge cases could not be handled manually.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The platform was framed as a control system: clear lifecycle management for the payment instrument, enforceable rules around transactions, and reconciliation as a repeatable process rather than an investigation. Interfaces to adjacent enterprise systems needed to preserve auditability so that operational decisions and financial outcomes stayed explainable.

## Outcome and Impact
A cashless settlement platform replaced paper coupons with cards, enabling automated settlements with 70,000+ legal entities. Reconciliation time was reduced sixfold, fraud-related losses fell tenfold, and the client formally recognized the business impact.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
Fraud reduction at scale is rarely a single “security feature”; it comes from designing the operating model so that traceability and control are built into how the business runs.
