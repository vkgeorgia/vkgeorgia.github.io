# Remuneration process redesign with AI-automation readiness (ADNO-TRMS)

## Context
A vertically integrated oil and gas company sought to overhaul remuneration planning and calculation for fixed and variable components. The existing cycle was long (around 11 weeks), error-prone, and exposed to human-factor risks, including weak transparency in bonus-related decisions.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision challenge was to redesign the process so that it becomes both faster and more controlled, while preparing it for selective automation. Automating a flawed process would amplify problems; redesigning without an automation perspective would preserve long cycle time and manual burden.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Remuneration decisions are sensitive and politically charged, raising the cost of ambiguity and inconsistency. Achieving a projected reduction to 1–2 weeks required clear decision points, standardized inputs, and explicit rules. Increased control improves transparency but can be perceived as reduced flexibility by stakeholders.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work structured the process around capabilities and decision points, then identified fragments suitable for AI-enabled assistance and automation. Agent requirements were defined in terms of roles, inputs/outputs, and interaction logic, with emphasis on explainability and governance rather than “black box” automation.

## Outcome and Impact
An agreed target process description and AI agent requirements were prepared, positioning the organization to move toward an AI-automated process. The design established a credible path to reduce cycle time from 11 weeks to 1–2 weeks while strengthening transparency and reducing error and abuse risks.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
Automation in sensitive processes works when it is a governance choice: the organization first agrees on decision rules and accountability, and only then uses AI to compress cycle time.
