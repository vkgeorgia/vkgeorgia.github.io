# People profile management under global compliance and organizational change

## Context
EPAM experienced large-scale organizational change driven by remote work and relocations. People data existed across fragmented and outdated systems, and the scope extended beyond employees to external contacts, students, and community members. Operating across 58 countries also raised significant data privacy obligations.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision was how to redesign people profile management so that it supports evolving organizational structures while remaining compliant and operable globally. A narrow HR-only approach would fail to address broader contact use cases; an overly broad approach risked unclear ownership and uncontrolled data growth.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Compliance requirements varied by country, and legacy data was inconsistent. Migration and transformation could not be treated as a one-time event because source systems and data formats continued to change. Strong governance improves privacy posture but can slow operational responsiveness if responsibilities and rules are not clearly defined.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work focused on defining requirements and operating rules for a profile storage capability: what constitutes a profile, how profiles change over time, how transformations are governed, and how consuming systems should interact with a single source of truth. The emphasis was on traceability and defensible compliance rather than tool-specific solutions.

## Outcome and Impact
A requirements and specification package for a new people profile management capability was established, supporting process efficiency improvements, reduction of accounting errors, and compliance alignment across countries. The work created a foundation for scalable evolution of the people data landscape.

## Lessons Learned
Global people data management is a governance problem first: without explicit rules and ownership, “data privacy compliance” becomes an endless set of exceptions rather than a stable operating model.
