# Operating model reset for an IT subsidiary with modern delivery practices (DME-29)

## Context
Domodedovo Integration (DI) faced low efficiency and an unattractive engineering environment, limiting talent attraction and reinforcing reliance on outdated technologies and ways of working. The department also needed to become viable for serving external clients, not only internal demand.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision was how to modernize DI’s operating model without turning transformation into a disruption spiral. Changing methods and structures can create short-term productivity loss; avoiding change entrenches unprofitability and weak market credibility.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Transformation needed to address both organizational structure and delivery practices while maintaining the ability to support ongoing work. Faster adoption of modern practices increases learning pressure; slower adoption prolongs the talent and credibility problem. The changes also had to align with an enterprise-level IT strategy.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The approach emphasized capability mapping and a roadmap that links business needs to IT improvements. Methodological changes were treated as governance choices: how work is prioritized, how change is managed, and how delivery becomes predictable and transparent for both internal and external clients.

## Outcome and Impact
DI gained the basis to work with external clients and adopted modern change and delivery practices, improving its ability to attract talent and build profitability over time. The organization also received a clearer, business-aligned IT direction for DI’s evolution.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
Operational transformation works when practices are tied to measurable business outcomes—predictability, talent retention, and customer trust—rather than adopted as “modernity” for its own sake.
