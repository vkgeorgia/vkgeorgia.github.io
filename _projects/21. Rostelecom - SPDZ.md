# Debtor notifications as a lever to reduce accounts receivable

## Context
Rostelecom faced growing accounts receivable, reducing operational flexibility and tying up funds. The existing debtor-informing practice relied on manual reconciliation statements and email correspondence, which was slow, inconsistent, and expensive to run.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision challenge was whether to treat receivables as a purely financial control problem or to address it as a communication and behavioral problem: timely, accurate notifications that change client behavior. If approached incorrectly, automation could increase disputes and dissatisfaction, while manual processes could not scale to the needed coverage.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Accuracy and timing were both critical: wrong or late notifications undermine trust and can increase operational load. The organization needed a consistent set of notification rules without building a fragile web of exceptions. The solution also had to reduce manual effort in reconciliation and paperwork, not shift it elsewhere.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The approach framed notifications as a governed service: clear event triggers (debt conditions), standardized content rules, and traceability from notification back to financial facts. This reduced ambiguity in how debt is determined and ensured the communication process remained auditable.

## Outcome and Impact
A unified notification approach and solution architecture were established and used for implementation. Accounts receivable decreased threefold, and the organization reduced time spent on reconciliation and paper/email handling, producing a material economic effect.

## Lessons Learned
Receivables reduction is often achieved not by stronger collections, but by making the organization’s expectations legible and timely—so that paying becomes the default, not a negotiation.
