# Data management platform architecture to productize telecom data

## Context
Rostelecom generated large volumes of data through core telecom services. The organization saw the opportunity to turn that data into internal decision support and external products, but that required a coherent infrastructure and operating model beyond ad-hoc analytics.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision was whether to scale data usage through a platform approach or through isolated solutions for each use case. Isolated solutions can produce quick wins, but they accumulate duplicated onboarding work, inconsistent definitions, and growing governance risk. A platform approach requires higher upfront clarity and prioritization.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Different consumers demand different SLAs and governance controls. A generic platform without prioritization risks becoming an expensive “warehouse of everything”; a narrow platform risks constraining future product ideas. The platform also needed to align with the operating reality of the Data Lab function.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work structured the future platform across business architecture, information concepts, and the data layer—explicitly connecting data suppliers, processing responsibilities, and consumption patterns. The emphasis was on making the roadmap practical: what must be standardized early, and what can evolve as products prove demand.

## Outcome and Impact
An architectural package for a DMP and a business-driven implementation direction were established and handed over for implementation, enabling the organization to pursue multiple data-based products and build a longer-term foundation for monetizing insights.

## Lessons Learned
The most valuable data platform outcome is not a repository; it is a repeatable way to onboard data and turn it into governed products without reinventing definitions every time.
