# Audit of reporting interface layer and data marts

## Context
Rostelecom.Restream depended on an interface layer and data marts to make operational and analytical data usable for business teams. The existing solution required review: misalignment with business needs, performance issues, or unclear ownership patterns can turn reporting into a bottleneck.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision was how to stabilize information access: whether to keep extending the existing layer with tactical fixes or to re-establish a coherent model of what data products exist, who owns them, and how they are consumed. A poor approach would prolong ambiguity and raise the cost of every new report or change request.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Business units depend on reporting while the underlying data landscape continues to evolve. Increasing rigor in data marts improves quality and performance, but it also requires tighter governance and a clearer data lifecycle. The work had to produce actionable documentation that engineering teams could use, not just observations.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The audit focused on system boundaries, data flows, and the mapping between business questions and data products. The goal was to reduce “unknowns”: clarify bottlenecks, document dependencies, and establish requirements for change that align business intent with technical feasibility.

## Outcome and Impact
A comprehensive analysis of the current solution and a documentation package for required changes were prepared, creating a stable basis for improving data accessibility and reducing risk in subsequent enhancements.

## Lessons Learned
Reporting platforms fail quietly: not by crashing, but by making every new decision slower. Clear data product boundaries and ownership are often the highest-leverage fix.
