# Establishing a marketing data analytics subdivision

## Context
Rostelecom needed to use large-scale behavioral data (visited sites, interests, web activity) to strengthen marketing outcomes: more precise targeting, timely churn response, and new data-driven products. The gap was not only technical—there was no dedicated operating model for turning this data into repeatable business capability.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision was whether to treat behavioral data as a byproduct of telecom services or as a strategic asset that justifies a dedicated organization, tools, and governance. Creating a new subdivision is costly and politically sensitive; failing to do so risks leaving valuable data unused and limiting the company’s marketing competitiveness.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
The subdivision needed a clear mandate and measurable outcomes, otherwise it would become an “analytics lab” without business pull. Using previously ignored data required agreement on ownership and quality expectations. Building a broad platform too early risked wasted effort; focusing too narrowly risked missing future product opportunities.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work framed the subdivision as a capability portfolio: behavior analysis, segmentation, omnichannel activation, and recommendations as connected decision loops. The emphasis was on defining responsibilities, interfaces to data suppliers/consumers, and metrics that let leadership assess whether the function is producing business value.

## Outcome and Impact
A new subdivision was created with analysts, project managers, and technical specialists, enabling systematic use of previously untapped behavioral data. The capability became a foundation for multiple data-driven products, including targeted advertising and recommendation-driven initiatives.

## Lessons Learned
Data organizations succeed when they are designed as product functions—with clear outcomes and decision rights—rather than as a collection of tools and experiments.
