# Subscription management blueprint for lead-to-cash transformation

## Context
Danfoss moved toward a service-based business model, which required subscription management as a connective layer between customer engagement and enterprise operations. The organization needed a coherent blueprint before committing to implementation.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision challenge was how to design a subscription capability that supports the business shift without creating a brittle integration layer. A weak design would lock the organization into expensive workarounds between commercial processes and operational fulfillment.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
Existing systems and processes set constraints on what could change first. A “perfect” target state would delay the transition; a minimal approach risked pushing complexity into manual processes. Vendor selection required a clear articulation of required capabilities and an understanding of where differentiation matters.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The work framed the subscription solution as a capability map and a blueprint of responsibilities and interfaces. The roadmap prioritized steps that unlock the transition: sequencing capabilities, clarifying ownership, and establishing a pragmatic integration approach between commercial and operational domains.

## Outcome and Impact
A solution blueprint, capability map, and prioritized roadmap were established, providing a clear basis for selecting a provider and proceeding into development with aligned expectations.

## Lessons Learned
Business model shifts are rarely blocked by technology alone; they are blocked by unclear responsibility boundaries. A good blueprint makes those boundaries explicit before the organization starts buying or building.
