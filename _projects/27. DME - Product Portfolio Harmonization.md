# Product portfolio rationalization and development process reset (DME-27)

## Context
Domodedovo Airport’s product portfolio had grown to 4,600 items without sufficient classification and governance, creating duplication, functional overlap, and outdated positions. The organization lacked a clear product strategy and a development process that could keep the portfolio efficient.

## The Decision Challenge
The decision was how aggressively to reduce and restructure the portfolio without damaging profitability. Cutting too cautiously would preserve inefficiency; cutting too aggressively would remove value-bearing products and create internal resistance. A second challenge was whether to treat the issue as catalog cleanup or as a process and operating model redesign.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
The portfolio spanned 19 legal entities, requiring a methodology that could be taught and applied consistently. Faster reduction favored rule-of-thumb decisions; sustainable improvement required classification, decision criteria, and a repeatable product development process. Change also needed to be acceptable to product owners and governance bodies.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The approach treated the portfolio as a managed system: classification, lifecycle rules, and decision criteria tied to profitability and operational impact. Process redesign targeted predictable time-to-market by clarifying stages, responsibilities, and the information required for product decisions.

## Outcome and Impact
The portfolio was reduced from 4,600 to 1,200 products without compromising profitability. Time-to-market decreased threefold, and the profit-per-product indicator increased through removal of inefficient duplication and clearer portfolio governance.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
Portfolio efficiency is not achieved by “cleaning a catalog”; it is achieved by making product decisions repeatable, with criteria that survive personnel change and organizational pressure.
