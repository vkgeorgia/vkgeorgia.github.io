# ERP standardization for operational transparency in a pre-sale period

## Context
Rostelecom.SkyLink entered a pre-sale phase where manageability and transparency mattered as much as operational performance. Fragmented operational data and non-standard reporting slowed decision-making and made it harder to demonstrate control over the business.

## The Decision Challenge
The key decision was whether to invest in standardization and a unified operational backbone under time pressure. A conservative path (minor fixes around legacy tools) preserved short-term comfort but risked leaving the organization with the same opacity at the worst moment. A more ambitious path improved transparency but required coordinated change and disciplined scope control.

## Constraints and Trade-offs
The work had to stabilize reporting and data access without disrupting ongoing operations. Integration with billing and support processes increased complexity: the system needed consistent boundaries between operational transactions, customer-facing billing, and user support. The pre-sale context favored predictability and auditability over customization.

## Architectural / Strategic Perspective
The approach centered on a single operational “source of truth” with clear integrations to adjacent systems. Reporting was treated as a management product: consistent definitions, traceability back to operational facts, and repeatable generation. Supportability was addressed as part of the operating model by establishing a clear path for issues and changes.

## Outcome and Impact
The organization gained timely access to operational data through a unified ERP backbone, with integration to billing and an established user support channel. Standardized reporting increased transparency and improved business manageability during the pre-sale period.

## Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
In pre-sale environments, enterprise systems are less about features and more about trust: the ability to explain the business with consistent data, repeatable reports, and controlled change.
