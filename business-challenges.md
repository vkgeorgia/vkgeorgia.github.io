# Business challenges I help leaders navigate

Most complex transformations do not fail because of technology.  
They fail because **high-stakes decisions are made without a clear, shared view of the system**.

I help business and technology leaders structure complex situations into **clear decision options**, evaluate trade-offs, and move forward with confidence — using enterprise architecture as a decision-making framework, not as documentation.

Below are the most common situations where clients reach out.

## Reorganization, M&A, structural change

Organizational change almost always exposes hidden dependencies between structure, processes, systems, and data.

**What typically happens**
- Business units are reorganized, but systems remain tied to the old structure.
- Overlaps and duplication appear across applications, data ownership, and vendors.
- Integration becomes a series of local fixes instead of a coherent operating model.

**What leaders need in this moment**
- Visibility into what must be preserved, consolidated, or redesigned.
- A pragmatic target picture aligned with the new business structure.
- Clear priorities that prevent “integration for the sake of integration”.

**Outcomes I aim for**
- Reduced complexity and duplication after organizational change.
- Faster harmonization of portfolios, processes, and ownership.
- Clear sequencing of integration decisions.
