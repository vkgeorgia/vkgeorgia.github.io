# Project Rules & Guidelines

This document serves as the operational manual for the `vkgeorgia.github.io` project.

## 1. Project Portfolio (`_projects/`)
*   **Rule**: The `_projects` directory is the **Single Source of Truth** for case studies.
*   **Structure**: Each project is a separate `.md` file.
*   **Project Codes**: 
    *   Codes (e.g., `RTK-PROTEUS`, `SKY-BARS`) must **NEVER** appear in the visible Title or Content Header.
    *   Codes must **ONLY** be stored in the `project_code` field in the frontmatter.
    *   *Correct*: `title: "Traffic analytics system"`
    *   *Incorrect*: `title: "Traffic analytics system (RTK-PROTEUS)"`
*   **Titles**: Use the `title` field in frontmatter for the human-readable project name.

## 2. Knowledge Base Structure
*   **`_projects/`**: STRICTLY for project portfolio cases. Jekyll uses this to build the "Cases" page.
*   **`knowledge-base/`**: For all other content (Bio, Education, Articles, Domains).
*   **`digital-avatar/backend/knowledge_base/`**: DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY. This folder is auto-generated by `deploy.sh`.

## 3. AI Avatar Persona
*   **Identity**: "M-Shape Architect", "Launcher", "Troubleshooter".
*   **Core Philosophy**: "Entropy Reduction".
*   **Tone**: Pragmatic, direct, result-oriented. NOT a passive assistant.
*   **Context**: The avatar relies on `profile.md`, `business-challenges.md`, and `index.md` (copied to root during build) for its core instructions.

## 4. Deployment
*   **Script**: Always use `digital-avatar/backend/deploy.sh` to deploy the avatar.
*   **Function**: This script handles the synchronization of `_projects` and `knowledge-base` into the Docker build context.
*   **Platform**: Deployment is targeted for `linux/amd64` on Google Cloud Run.
