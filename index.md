# Helping leaders make sound technology decisions in times of change

Reorganization, growth, cost pressure, and risk often appear as technology problems —  
but in reality, they are **decision problems**.

I help business and technology leaders make clear, well-founded decisions by using enterprise architecture as a **decision-making framework**, not as documentation.

Over 20 years of experience supporting complex technology and organizational decisions in large and mid-size enterprises across multiple industries.

## When leaders usually reach out to me

Most engagements start when organizations face one or more of these situations:

- **Reorganization, merger, or structural change**, where existing systems and processes no longer support the new operating model.
- Pressure to **increase revenue or profitability**, while technology investments feel disconnected from business outcomes.
- The need to **reduce costs or optimize a business unit** without breaking critical capabilities.
- Growing concern about **risk** — legacy systems, fragmented architecture, regulatory exposure, or AI-related uncertainty.

In these moments, speed matters — but **clarity matters more**, because wrong decisions become expensive.

## What I do — in simple terms

Many companies struggle to understand what an enterprise architect actually does.  
So here it is, plainly.

First, I listen to business leaders and stakeholders to understand the **real problem**, not just its symptoms. My business education and long experience in enterprise environments allow me to speak the same language as management — not only IT.

Next, I help articulate:
- the **current state** of the organization and its technology landscape;
- the **desired future state** — what the business is truly trying to achieve.

Then, based on experience and modern technologies, I outline **realistic decision options and next steps**, always accounting for constraints, resources, and risk.

The result is a **clear, actionable direction** that connects business intent with technology decisions.

In short:  
**I help organizations solve business problems through sound technology decisions.**

## How to start

If you are facing a complex decision related to reorganization, transformation, growth, cost optimization, or risk management, a short conversation is often the best place to start.

We clarify:
- the decision that actually needs to be made,
- the constraints and stakeholders involved,
- what information is missing to decide well.
