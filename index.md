# Helping leaders make sound technology decisions in times of change

Reorganization, growth, cost pressure, and risk often appear as technology problems —  
but in reality, they are **decision problems**.

I help business and technology leaders make clear, well-founded decisions by using enterprise architecture as a **decision-making framework**, not as documentation.

Over 20 years of experience supporting complex technology and organizational decisions in large and mid-size enterprises across multiple industries.

## When leaders usually reach out to me

Most engagements start when organizations face one or more of these situations:

- **Reorganization, merger, or structural change**, where existing systems and processes no longer support the new operating model.
- Pressure to **increase revenue or profitability**, while technology investments feel disconnected from business outcomes.
- The need to **reduce costs or optimize a business unit** without breaking critical capabilities.
- Growing concern about **risk** — legacy systems, fragmented architecture, regulatory exposure, or AI-related uncertainty.

In these moments, speed matters — but **clarity matters more**, because wrong decisions become expensive.

## What I do — in simple terms

Many companies struggle to understand what an enterprise architect actually does.  
So here it is, plainly.

First, I listen to business leaders and stakeholders to understand the **real problem**, not just its symptoms. My business education and long experience in enterprise environments allow me to speak the same language as management — not only IT.

Next, I help articulate:
- the **current state** of the organization and its technology landscape;
- the **desired future state** — what the business is truly trying to achieve.

Then, based on experience and modern technologies, I outline **realistic decision options and next steps**, always accounting for constraints, resources, and risk.

The result is a **clear, actionable direction** that connects business intent with technology decisions.

In short:  
**I help organizations solve business problems through sound technology decisions.**

## How I help leaders move from complexity to clarity

My work combines enterprise architecture, business analysis, and strategic thinking — but the focus is always on **decision quality**, not artifacts.

Typically, I help organizations:

- Identify the **root causes** behind strategic or operational challenges
- Structure complex situations into **clear decision options**
- Evaluate **trade-offs** between cost, risk, speed, and long-term sustainability
- Align business strategy, architecture, and execution
- Build roadmaps that leaders can actually use to act with confidence

I do not sell frameworks or documents.  
I help leadership teams **see the landscape clearly and decide deliberately**.

## Who I am

I am an Enterprise Architect and Business Analyst with **20+ years of experience** working at the intersection of business, technology, and transformation.

I have worked across multiple industries — including telecom, retail, oil & gas, transportation, healthcare, manufacturing, and public sector — but my value does not come from industry templates.

It comes from a **systemic perspective**:

- abstracting away industry noise and focusing on **goals, capabilities, and structure**;
- assessing organizations objectively, regardless of domain;
- designing solutions based on **strategic intent**, not recycled patterns.

Industry experience is useful — but it can also be limiting.  
My role is to help each organization find a **coherent and sustainable path forward**.

## Selected outcomes

- **Large transportation hub**: supported IT reorganization and product portfolio harmonization, reducing the portfolio from 4600 to 1200 products, tripling time-to-market, and enabling new revenue streams.
- **Energy sector**: designed loyalty and fleet management systems, migrated infrastructure to cloud, and reduced operating costs by an order of magnitude.
- **Telecom & manufacturing**: led architecture and analytical initiatives that enabled platform transformation and process automation at enterprise scale.

(Details and additional cases are available in the *Cases* section.)

## How I usually work with clients

Common engagement formats include:

- **Executive technology and architecture advisory**
- **Decision support** during reorganization, transformation, or high-risk initiatives
- **Ongoing advisory support** when continuity matters more than one-off recommendations
- **Embedded or fractional architect roles** in complex change programs

The common denominator is responsibility for **decision quality**, not just delivery.
