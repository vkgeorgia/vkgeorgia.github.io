# Application Portfolio Optimization

Application landscapes tend to grow quietly — until cost, risk, and complexity become impossible to ignore.

I help organizations make their application portfolio **visible, understandable, and actionable**.

## When this service is typically needed

This service is useful when:

- operating costs continue to rise;
- legacy systems block change;
- ownership and accountability are unclear;
- rationalization efforts repeatedly stall.

Portfolio decisions require **structural insight**, not arbitrary cuts.

## What I help leaders decide

The focus is on decisions such as:

- which applications genuinely support critical capabilities;
- where redundancy adds risk rather than resilience;
- what can be retired, consolidated, or modernized;
- how to sequence change safely.

- transparency over assumptions;
- objective criteria tied to business value;

## How to start
