# Technology Strategy Advisory

Technology strategy is rarely about choosing technologies.  
It is about **deciding where to invest, what to prioritize, and what trade-offs to accept**.

I help leaders connect business intent with technology decisions in a way that supports growth, profitability, and long-term sustainability.

## When this service is typically needed

This advisory is most useful when:

- growth initiatives require platform or architectural decisions;
- technology spending increases without clear business outcomes;
- build vs buy decisions become recurring and contentious;
- different teams push conflicting priorities.

In these moments, a clear technology strategy provides **direction, not control**.

## What I help leaders decide

Typical decision areas include:

- platform and ecosystem strategy;
- investment priorities across products and capabilities;
- trade-offs between speed, flexibility, and cost;
- criteria for build, buy, or partner decisions.

The goal is not a perfect strategy document, but **decision coherence over time**.

## How this advisory works

The work focuses on:

- making implicit assumptions explicit;
- structuring strategic options and their consequences;
- stress-testing decisions against business goals and constraints;
- supporting leadership alignment.

Strategy emerges through **deliberate choices**, not prescriptions.

## Typical outcomes

Clients typically experience:

- clearer rationale behind technology investments;
- improved alignment between business and IT leadership;
- fewer reactive decisions and course corrections;
- stronger link between strategy and execution.

## How to start

The advisory usually starts with a strategic question or investment decision that lacks clarity.
