# Digital Transformation Advisory

Many digital transformations fail not because of technology, but because **change lacks a coherent direction**.

I help organizations reconnect transformation efforts with business intent and architectural reality.

## When this service is typically needed

This service is relevant when:

- multiple initiatives compete without a shared direction;
- transformation has become a collection of projects;
- leadership struggles to see progress or outcomes;
- fatigue and skepticism begin to grow.

Transformation requires **structure and sequencing**, not just momentum.

---

## What I help leaders focus on

I support leaders in:

- clarifying what transformation is meant to achieve;
- identifying dependencies and constraints;
- deciding which changes matter now — and which can wait;
- aligning structure, processes, and technology.

The emphasis is on **making change manageable**.
