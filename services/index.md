# Services

These services are not about producing documents or applying frameworks.

They are designed to support **high-stakes decisions** where business goals, organizational structure, technology, cost, and risk intersect — and where clarity matters more than speed.

Each service below represents a **format of decision support**, not a predefined delivery model.

---

## Executive Architecture Advisory

**Ongoing decision support for leaders facing complex, high-stakes technology and architecture choices.**

This service is for situations where decisions recur over time and their consequences accumulate.  
Continuity, context, and senior judgment matter more than one-off recommendations.

## Enterprise Architecture Consulting

**Using architecture as a decision framework to align strategy, structure, and execution.**

Most often used during reorganization, mergers, or large-scale transformation, when organizations lose coherence and need a clear structural direction.

---

## Technology Strategy Advisory

**Connecting business strategy with technology investment decisions and trade-offs.**

Focused on questions such as platform strategy, build vs buy, prioritization, and aligning technology choices with growth and profitability goals.

## Digital Transformation Advisory

**Turning fragmented initiatives into coherent, outcome-driven change.**

Helps organizations regain direction when transformation efforts stall, multiply, or drift away from original business intent.

---

## Application Portfolio Optimization

**Reducing cost and complexity by making the application landscape visible and actionable.**

Used when cost pressure, legacy systems, or duplication make the landscape hard to manage and even harder to change safely.

---

## AI Readiness & Governance

**Preparing architecture, data, and governance for responsible and sustainable AI adoption.**

Focused on making AI initiatives manageable at enterprise scale — before experimentation quietly turns into structural risk.

## How to choose the right starting point

Clients rarely start with a service.  
They usually start with a **business challenge**.

If you are unsure which format fits your situation:
- start from the challenges you are facing,
- then explore the relevant service.

## How engagements typically work

The exact format always depends on context, but most engagements involve:
- clarifying the decision that needs to be made,
- understanding constraints and trade-offs,
- supporting leaders as decisions evolve over time.

Details are discussed after an initial conversation.
