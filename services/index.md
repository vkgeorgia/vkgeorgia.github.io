These services are not about "advice." They are about **intervention**.

I operate as a **functional extension** of your leadership team during critical phases of ensuring order (FIX) or creating new capabilities (BUILD).

My goal in every engagement is to build a system so clear and robust that **I am no longer needed**.

---

## Architecture Intervention & Crisis Management (FIX)

**Stabilizing chaotic IT landscapes and recovering failing initiatives.**

This is for situations where "business as usual" has broken down.
*   **Recover** critical projects that are over budget or stalled.
*   **Untangle** complex vendor dependencies and spaghetti architecture.
*   **Establish** immediate operational control and transparency.

## Enterprise Restructuring (FIX)

**Aligning organizational structure with technology strategy.**

Most often used during M&A, post-merger integration, or cost-cutting phases.
*   **Map** the reality of capabilities vs. costs.
*   **Eliminate** redundancy in processes and systems.
*   **Design** a lean operating model that scales.

## Tech Strategy & Investment Control (BUILD)

**Ensuring technology choices drive ROI, not just technical debt.**

Focused on high-stakes choices: Build vs. Buy, Cloud Native vs. Hybrid, Monolith vs. Microservices.
*   **Validate** investment hypothesis with architectural rigor.
*   **Select** technologies that reduce, not increase, long-term entropy.
*   **Define** clear KPIs for technology adoption.

## Transformation Launch Control (BUILD)

**Turning "Digital Transformation" buzzwords into shipping code and product.**

Helps organizations move from "slides" to "production" by enforcing strict scope and sequence.
*   **Launch** new digital products with a "Launcher" mindset.
*   **Break** analysis paralysis with rapid prototyping and MVPs.
*   **Enforce** delivery discipline across distributed teams.

## Application Portfolio Rationalization (FIX)

**Ruthlessly reducing run-costs and legacy drag.**

Used when the IT budget is consumed by "keeping the lights on."
*   **Audit** the full application landscape.
*   **Identify** zombie systems and commercially unjustifiable deviations.
*   **Execute** decommissioning and consolidation plans.

## AI Governance & Agent Frameworks (BUILD)

**Architecting the next generation of autonomous business systems.**

Preparing your environment for agentic workforces, not just chatbots.
*   **Design** "human-in-the-loop" workflows.
*   **Structure** data for machine consumption (RAG).
*   **Deploy** pragmatic AI agents to automate routine knowledge work.

## How to engage

I filter for **fit**, not just budget.

*   **Ideal Fit**: You want to fix a crisis, launch something new, or significantly reduce operational entropy. You are ready to make hard decisions.
*   **Poor Fit**: you need "staff argumentation" or steady-state administration.

If you have a challenge, let's discuss if I am the right tool for the job.
