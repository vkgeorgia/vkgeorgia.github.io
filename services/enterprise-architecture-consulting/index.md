# Enterprise Architecture Consulting

Enterprise architecture is often misunderstood as documentation or standardization.  
In practice, its real value emerges when organizations face **structural change** and need to make decisions that will shape them for years.

I use enterprise architecture as a **decision framework** — to help leaders understand their organization as a system and choose a coherent direction.

## When this service is typically needed

Organizations usually engage this service when:

- reorganization or M&A exposes misalignment between structure and systems;
- transformation initiatives multiply without a shared architectural direction;
- business and IT priorities diverge;
- complexity increases faster than the organization’s ability to manage it.

In these situations, architecture becomes a way to **see the whole**, not just optimize parts.

## What I help leaders understand and decide

Through an architectural lens, I help clarify:

- how business goals translate into **capabilities and structure**;
- which elements of the current landscape are constraints versus choices;
- where complexity adds value — and where it only adds cost and risk;
- which architectural options support long-term sustainability.

The emphasis is always on **options and trade-offs**, not on producing models for their own sake.

## How architecture is used in practice

The work typically involves:

- establishing a shared view of the current state;
- defining a target direction that reflects strategic intent;
- identifying decision points and sequencing change;
- supporting leadership discussions around priorities and constraints.

Architecture serves as a **shared language for decision-making**, not as an abstract discipline.

## Typical outcomes

Clients typically gain:

- clarity about structural implications of strategic decisions;
- reduced friction between business and technology teams;
- a coherent direction for transformation initiatives;
- fewer surprises caused by hidden dependencies.

## How to start

This service usually begins with clarifying the **decision or change** the organization is facing and assessing whether an architectural perspective would improve decision quality.
