# AI Readiness & Governance

AI initiatives often begin as experiments — and quietly turn into **enterprise-level risk**.

I help organizations prepare for AI adoption in a way that is responsible, sustainable, and aligned with their structure and goals.

---

## When this service is typically needed

This advisory is relevant when:

- AI initiatives emerge bottom-up without coordination;
- data quality and ownership are unclear;
- regulatory or ethical concerns increase;
- leadership wants to scale AI responsibly.

AI readiness is as much about **governance and architecture** as it is about models.

## What I help leaders clarify

The focus includes:

- readiness of data, platforms, and architecture;
- accountability and decision rights;
- boundaries between experimentation and production;
- alignment between AI use cases and business value.

---

## How this advisory works

The work typically involves:

- assessing structural readiness;
- identifying risks before scaling;
- defining guardrails rather than rigid rules;
- supporting leadership alignment.

---

## Typical outcomes

Organizations typically gain:

- clearer understanding of AI-related risks;
- controlled and transparent AI adoption;
- stronger alignment between innovation and responsibility;
- fewer surprises as AI initiatives scale.
