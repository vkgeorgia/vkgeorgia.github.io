## Process Modeling & Optimization

* Modelled current and target-state business processes using BPMN and other notations.
* Identified inefficiencies, proposed improvements, and supported automation efforts across product development, finance, retail operations, and IT support processes.
* Created executable process models and supported handover to developers and QA teams.
