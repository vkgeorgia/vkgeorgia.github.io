# Summary

With a unique blend of technical and business education, I bring a comprehensive understanding of enterprise architecture and business analysis. My experience spans aviation, transport, telecommunications, retail, and oil and gas retail. I have a strong passion for creating innovative solutions. I like methodological tasks like organising business analysis team operations and creating enterprise architecture management functions.

My superpower is my ability to simplify complex concepts. My extensive work on consulting projects has given me a powerful impulse for development. I have encountered and successfully resolved numerous challenging business cases and situations, which have refined my problem-solving skills. Now, I am confident in my ability to help companies improve.

As an author of courses on management, enterprise architecture, and rhetoric and a university-level instructor, I am committed to sharing my knowledge. My interests in economics, investments, enterprise architecture, rhetoric, and management focus on building successful enterprises.
