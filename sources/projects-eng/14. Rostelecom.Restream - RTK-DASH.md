## Project: RTK-DASH â€“ Interface Layer (Information Presentation System, Data Marts)

**Industry:** Telecom
**Employer:** Rostelecom.Restream
**Client:** Rostelecom.Restream
**Project Code:** RTK-DASH
**Start Date:** Oct 2016
**End Date:** Oct 2018
**Role(s):** Business Analyst
**Key Result:** Analysis and audit of the existing solution were performed, and documentation for changes to the information presentation system and data marts was prepared.

### Situation
Rostelecom.Restream, as a large telecommunications company, faced challenges in effectively presenting and accessing its data. The absence of an optimized interface layer or data marts could have led to difficulties for business users in obtaining necessary analytics, slow report performance, or an incomplete picture of operational activities. The existing solution might have been outdated, inefficient, or not aligned with current business needs.

### Task
In my role as Business Analyst, my task was to conduct an analysis and audit of the existing interface layer and data mart systems. The goal was to identify problems, define needs for changes, and prepare detailed documentation that would serve as a basis for their implementation. This was intended to improve the accessibility and quality of information for business decision-making.

### Actions
* **Gathered and Analyzed Current State:** Conducted a detailed study of the current information presentation system and data marts, including their architecture (Big Data, BI, DWH), utilized technologies, data loading and processing procedures, and functionality available to end-users.
* **Stakeholder Interaction:** Held interviews and workshops with various business units (marketing, sales, finance, technical departments) to understand their data needs, challenges with the existing system, and expectations for changes.
* **Solution Audit:** Performed an audit of the current solution, identifying bottlenecks, inefficiencies, data errors, performance issues, and missing functional capabilities.
* **Formulated Requirements for Changes:** Based on the conducted analysis and audit, I formulated clear, detailed requirements for changes to the system. This included requirements for new data marts, modifications to existing ones, performance improvements, expansion of BI reporting functionality, etc.
* **Prepared Documentation:** Developed a complete set of documentation for the changes, which included: functional specifications, data schemas, data flow descriptions, user scenarios, and recommendations for system optimization and refinement. This documentation was intended to serve as a guide for the development team.
* **Documentation Alignment:** Presented and aligned the developed documentation with all key stakeholders, including business owners and technical teams, to ensure a unified understanding and acceptance of the proposed changes.

### Result
As a result of my work:
* **Comprehensive Analysis and Solution Audit Performed:** The company gained a deep understanding of the state of its interface layer and data marts, as well as identified problems and potential improvements.
* **Exhaustive Documentation for Changes Prepared:** A detailed package of documents was created, serving as a clear guide for further development and modification of the information presentation system.
* **Foundation Laid for Improved Data Accessibility:** The groundwork was laid for enhancing the efficiency of business users' access to necessary information, which should contribute to faster and more informed management decisions.
* **Improved Interaction Between Business and IT Departments:** Clearly formulated and agreed-upon requirements facilitated more effective collaboration between departments.
* **Reduced Risks in Future Enhancements:** The availability of current and complete documentation reduces the risks of errors and rework in subsequent phases of system development.
