## Project: GAM-ZG â€“ Fuel Station Management System (FSMS)

**Industry:** Retail & Fuel
**Domain:** Fuel Retail Management
**Employer:** Gamma
**Client:** Zmey Gorynych Gas Station Network
**Project Code:** GAM-ZG
**Start Date:** Jan 2015
**End Date:** Dec 2019
**Role(s):** Solution Architect, Project Manager
**Key Result:** Implemented fuel station system with integration and migration.

### Situation
Zmey Gorynych Gas Station Network likely faced the need to modernize or replace their existing fuel station management system. This could have been due to the inefficiency of the current solution, a lack of necessary functionalities, difficulties with integration with other business systems, or the need to migrate data from an older platform to enhance operational efficiency and manageability of the network.

### Task
In my roles as Solution Architect and Project Manager, my task was to implement a new fuel station management system for the Zmey Gorynych Gas Station Network. This included designing the solution, its implementation, ensuring necessary integration with other systems, and successfully migrating data from the old platform to the new one. The ultimate goal was to enhance overall operational efficiency and provide modern capabilities for managing the gas station network.

### Actions
I undertook the following actions over a period of 5 years (from January 2015 to December 2019):
* **Requirements Gathering and Analysis:** Conducted a detailed collection and analysis of business requirements for the new FSMS, including functionalities for fuel inventory management, sales, payments, personnel, and reporting.
* **Solution Architecture Design:** As Solution Architect, I developed a comprehensive architecture for the FSMS, defining modules, their interactions, and necessary integrations. PHP and 1C technologies were utilized in development.
* **Managed Development and Implementation Project:** As Project Manager, I was responsible for all aspects of project management: planning, task allocation, risk management, timeline, and budget control. I led the team of developers and other specialists throughout all stages of the project lifecycle, including development, testing, and implementation.
* **Integration with Existing Systems:** Organized and oversaw efforts to integrate the new FSMS with other internal and external client systems (e.g., accounting systems, loyalty programs, payment terminals).
* **Data Migration Planning and Execution:** Developed a strategy for data migration from the old platform to the new one, and managed the process of data extraction, transformation, and loading, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.
* **System Setup and Configuration:** Supervised the setup and configuration of the system in accordance with the business processes of the Zmey Gorynych Gas Station Network.
* **Testing, Training, and Launch:** Organized comprehensive system testing, end-user training, and the subsequent phased launch of the platform into production across all gas stations in the network.

### Result
As a result of my work, the client gained:
* **Successfully Implemented Fuel Station Management System:** The Zmey Gorynych Gas Station Network received a modern and efficient tool for managing its operations.
* **Comprehensive Integration Achieved:** The new system was successfully integrated with all necessary internal and external services, ensuring a seamless data flow.
* **Data Migration Completed:** All historical and current data were successfully migrated to the new platform, allowing for continuity of operations and analysis.
* **Enhanced Operational Efficiency:** Automation and centralization of processes led to increased efficiency in FSMS management and reduced manual operations.
* **Improved Network Manageability:** Management gained more transparent and complete control over all aspects of gas station operations.
