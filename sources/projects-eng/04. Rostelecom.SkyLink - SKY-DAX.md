### Situation
Rostelecom.SkyLink, being in a pre-sale phase (implying the need to enhance attractiveness and manageability for potential buyers), faced the challenge of lacking a unified system for managing operational data. This resulted in insufficient transparency, fragmented information, delays in data access, and difficulties in generating reports. Existing systems likely did not provide the necessary level of standardization and manageability.

### Task
In my roles as Solution Architect, Project Manager, and MS Dynamics Administrator, the task was to implement a unified ERP system based on Microsoft Dynamics AX. The goal was to ensure transparent and timely access to operational data, integrate the ERP with the billing system, launch a Helpdesk, standardize the IT landscape, and organize transparent reporting to enhance business manageability during the critical pre-sale period.

### Actions
To achieve these goals, I undertook the following actions over a period of 2 years (from August 2008 to August 2010):
* **Analyzed Business Processes and Requirements:** Conducted a deep analysis of the company's current business processes and gathered detailed requirements from key departments to design the ERP system's functionality.
* **Designed Solution Architecture:** As Solution Architect, I developed the implementation architecture for Microsoft Dynamics AX, including necessary modules and their interaction logic.
* **Managed Implementation Project:** As Project Manager, I was responsible for all phases of the ERP implementation, including planning, resource allocation, risk management, timeline, and budget control.
* **Integrated with Billing System:** Oversaw the integration efforts between the ERP system and the existing company billing system, ensuring seamless data exchange and a unified client view.
* **Launched Helpdesk:** Organized the deployment and launch of an integrated Helpdesk for users of the new ERP system, ensuring prompt resolution of issues.
* **Standardized and Configured the System:** In my role as MS Dynamics Administrator, I oversaw the setup and configuration of the Microsoft Dynamics AX system, ensuring its alignment with business processes and company standards.
* **Organized Reporting:** Developed and configured mechanisms for generating transparent and consolidated reports, essential for operational management and strategic planning.
* **Provided User Training and Support:** Organized end-user training and provided necessary support to ensure effective utilization of the new ERP system.
