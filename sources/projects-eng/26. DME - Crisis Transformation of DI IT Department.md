## Project: DME-26 – Crisis Transformation of DI IT Department

**Industry:** Transport
**Domain:** Strategic Management, Strategic Planning, Enterprise Architecture
**Employer:** DME Airport
**Client:** DME Airport
**Project Code:** DME-26
**Start Date:** Mar 2019
**End Date:** Dec 2019
**Role(s):** Enterprise Architect
**Key Result:** Successfully reoriented the IT department's work towards external clients, opening new revenue streams and ensuring enterprise sustainability during the crisis.

### Situation
With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chairman of the Board of Directors tasked me with leading crisis management in the Domodedovo Integration (DI) IT department. This department traditionally served only the internal client—the airport—and its survival was threatened as the aviation industry was hit hard by the crisis.

### Task
My primary task was two-fold:
**Strategic:** Develop and implement measures to preserve the enterprise during the crisis by reorienting the IT department's work towards external clients to ensure sustainability and find new revenue streams.
**Operational:** Identify and repackage enterprise products for the external market, develop a market entry strategy, and a marketing plan.

### Actions
I undertook the following actions over a period of 10 months (from March to December 2019):
* **Strategic Reorientation:** In collaboration with the DI marketing department, I developed and implemented strategies to adapt the business model, focusing on providing IT services to external clients. A market entry strategy for new services was developed.
* **Product Repackaging:** We identified enterprise products that could be offered to external clients and, based on them, created a product line oriented toward the external market. A review of existing products was conducted, many of which required repackaging and updating to meet market requirements.
* **Marketing Plan Development:** A marketing plan was developed to promote the introduction of new services to the market.

### Result
As a result of my work:
* **Successful Reorientation:** The IT department's operations were successfully reoriented, ensuring its sustainability during the crisis and opening new revenue streams through the effective launch of products into the external market.
* **Formal Recognition:** I received a letter of commendation from management for my contribution to the adaptation and preservation of the enterprise.
