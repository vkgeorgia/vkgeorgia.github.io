## Project: SKY-ZUP â€“ 1C: Payroll & HR

**Industry:** Telecom
**Employer:** Rostelecom.SkyLink
**Client:** Rostelecom.SkyLink
**Project Code:** SKY-ZUP
**Start Date:** Aug 2008
**End Date:** Aug 2010
**Role(s):** Business Analyst, Project Manager
**Key Result:** Introduced a single payroll and motivation system across all branches, integrated with the budgeting system. Launched HR system for 50+ users.

### Situation
Rostelecom.SkyLink, with its widespread branch network, faced challenges in unifying its payroll and human resources management systems. The absence of a single system led to discrepancies in accruals, complexities in managing motivational schemes, and inefficiencies in HR record-keeping. It also hindered data integration with financial systems, such as budgeting.

### Task
In my dual role as Business Analyst and Project Manager, my task was to implement a unified payroll and HR management system across all branches of Rostelecom.SkyLink. The goal was to standardize payroll and motivation processes, launch a fully functional HR system for over 50 users, and ensure integration with the budgeting system (BARS).

### Actions
To achieve these goals, I undertook the following actions over a period of 2 years (from August 2008 to August 2010):
* **Analyzed Current Processes:** Conducted a detailed analysis of the existing payroll calculation, motivation management, and HR record-keeping processes in various branches.
* **Gathered and Analyzed Requirements:** Collaborated with key stakeholders (accounting, HR department, branch management) to gather and formalize requirements for the new unified system.
* **Designed and Configured the System:** Developed the functional specification and oversaw the configuration of the 1C:Salary and HR Management system in accordance with the identified requirements and specificities of all branches.
* **Managed Project and Team:** As Project Manager, I was responsible for planning, coordinating, and controlling all project phases, including development, testing, data migration, and implementation. I led the team, ensuring adherence to timelines and quality standards.
* **Unified Processes:** Worked on standardizing payroll calculation methodologies and the application rules for motivational schemes across all branches.
* **Integration:** Planned and oversaw the integration efforts of the new HR system with the existing BARS budgeting system to ensure end-to-end financial planning and cost control for personnel.
* **Training and Support:** Organized user training for the new system and provided necessary support during the implementation phase.

### Result
As a result of my work:
* **A Unified Payroll and Motivation System was Implemented:** The 1C:Salary and HR Management system was successfully deployed, providing unified accruals across all branches.
* **HR System was Launched:** A fully operational HR system was brought into use, serving over 50 HR and other department employees.
