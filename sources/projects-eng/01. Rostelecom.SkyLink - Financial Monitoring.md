## Project: SKY-BARS â€“ Financial Monitoring

**Industry:** Telecom

**Employer:** Rostelecom.SkyLink

**Client:** Rostelecom.SkyLink

**Project Code:** SKY-BARS

**Start Date:** Aug 2008

**End Date:** Aug 2010

**Role(s):** Business Analyst, Project Manager

**Key Result:** Automated internal financial control system. Implemented a budgeting and control process that reduced the budget preparation cycle from 6 months to 2 and improved financial transparency.

### Situation
Rostelecom.SkyLink (as both an internal client and employer) needed to improve its financial processes. The existing internal financial control, budgeting, and monitoring processes were inefficient, highly time-consuming (the budget preparation cycle took up to 6 months), and likely suffered from a lack of transparency, which hindered agile and accurate financial management.

### Task
In my dual role as Business Analyst and Project Manager, my task was to develop and implement an automated internal financial control system and enhance the budgeting and control process. The goal was to significantly reduce the budget preparation cycle, increase financial transparency, and enable more effective management of the company's financial flows.

### Actions
To achieve these goals, I undertook the following actions over a period of 2 years (from August 2008 to August 2010):
* **Analyzed Existing Financial Processes:** Conducted a detailed analysis of the current budgeting, financial control, and monitoring processes, identifying key bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
* **Gathered and Analyzed Requirements:** Collaborated with stakeholders from financial and management departments to gather and formalize requirements for the new system and processes.
* **Designed Automated System:** Developed the architecture and functional requirements for the automated internal financial control system.
* **Managed Project and Team:** As Project Manager, I organized and led the development team, ensuring adherence to timelines, budget, and project quality. I oversaw the entire development and implementation lifecycle.
* **Implemented Budgeting and Control Processes:** Designed and implemented new, optimized processes for budgeting and financial control.
* **Leveraged Technologies:** Oversaw development utilizing Microsoft C#, MS SQL Server for the database, MS SQL Analysis Services for analytics, and MS SQL Reporting Services for reporting, to create a robust and scalable solution.
* **Conducted Testing and Training:** Organized system testing and trained end-users to ensure a smooth transition and effective utilization of the new system.

### Result
As a result of my work:
* **An Automated Internal Financial Control System was Created and Implemented:** The SKY-BARS system is successfully functioning, providing effective control over financial operations.
* **The Budget Preparation Cycle was Significantly Reduced:** The time required for budget preparation was **cut from 6 months to 2 months**, representing a 3-fold reduction.
* **Financial Transparency was Enhanced:** The new processes and system provided much greater transparency of financial data, enabling management to make more informed decisions.
* **Improved Financial Flow Management:** The company gained tools for more accurate and timely control over its expenditures and revenues.
* **Overall Financial Management Efficiency Increased:** The project contributed to optimizing resource utilization and fostering greater discipline in financial activities.
