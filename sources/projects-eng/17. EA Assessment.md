**Industry:** Telecom
**Employer:** Rostelecom.Restream
**Client:** Rostelecom.Restream
**Project Code:** RTK-EA
**Start Date:** Jan 2017
**End Date:** Jan 2019
**Role(s):** Enterprise Architect
**Key Result:** Conducted EA Assessment. Delivered EA baseline and transformation roadmap, providing a foundation for crucial organizational decisions and change implementation.

### Situation
Rostelecom.Restream, as a subsidiary of the large operator Rostelecom, was actively developing and expanding. To ensure organic, reasonable, and manageable growth, strategic planning was required. The company's management expressed a need for a clear roadmap of proposed changes to guide this growth and future initiatives.

### Task
In my role as Enterprise Architect, the primary task was to create a roadmap for change. This necessitated conducting a comprehensive enterprise assessment, meticulously documenting its current state (baseline), gathering requirements for the future target state, and developing a detailed transformation plan.

### Actions
I undertook the following actions over a period of 2 years (from January 2017 to January 2019):
* **Enterprise Assessment:** Conducted a comprehensive assessment of the enterprise to gain a full understanding of its current business processes, organizational structure, information systems, and technological infrastructure.
* **Stakeholder Interviews:** Conducted numerous interviews with various stakeholders at all levels of the organization to gather their opinions, needs, and expectations for the future architecture.
* **Current State Documentation (Baseline EA):** Meticulously documented the current state of the enterprise architecture, creating a detailed "baseline" that served as a starting point for changes. For diagrams, I used Archimate notation, ensuring a standardized and understandable representation.
* **Future State Requirements Gathering:** Gathered and formalized requirements for the target (future) state of the enterprise architecture, considering the company's strategic growth and development goals.
* **Transformation Roadmap Development:** Based on the analysis of the current state and requirements for the future, and guided by the TOGAF methodology, I developed a detailed transformation roadmap. This roadmap included phases, projects, dependencies, and expected outcomes of the changes.
* **Presentation and Alignment:** Presented the developed roadmap, as well as the current and future state of the architecture, to management and key stakeholders for discussion and alignment.

### Result
As a result of my work:
* **A Carefully Developed Change Roadmap was Produced:** The company's management received a clear, comprehensive, and meticulously developed roadmap for future transformations.
* **Current and Future EA States Presented:** Detailed descriptions of the current baseline enterprise architecture (EA baseline) and its target state were created and presented, ensuring a unified vision.
* **Foundation Laid for Organizational Decision-Making:** The results of my work served as a solid foundation for making important strategic and organizational decisions regarding the company's development.
* **Basis for Change Implementation Ensured:** The roadmap and state descriptions provided a clear plan for the subsequent implementation of changes, contributing to Rostelecom.Restream's organic and managed growth.
