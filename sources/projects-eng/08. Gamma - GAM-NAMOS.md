## Project: GAM-NAMOS â€“ Petrol Station Management System (PSMS)

**Industry:** Retail & Fuel
**Employer:** Gamma
**Client:** Wincor Nixdorf
**Project Code:** GAM-NAMOS
**Start Date:** Apr 2012
**End Date:** Oct 2015
**Role(s):** System Analyst
**Key Result:** An architecture audit of the existing, already implemented fuel retail management system (Namos) at petrol stations was performed. Documentation for the existing software was created in accordance with local and European standards.

### Situation
Wincor Nixdorf, as a developer and supplier of the Petrol Station Management System (Namos), faced the challenge of lacking up-to-date and standardized architectural documentation for its already implemented and operational software. This likely hindered system support, future development, integration with other solutions, and compliance with local and European regulatory requirements.

### Task
In my role as System Analyst, my task was to conduct an architectural audit of the existing fuel retail management system (Namos) and create complete and current documentation for this software. This documentation needed to comply with both local and European standards, ensuring system transparency and manageability.

### Actions
To achieve these goals, I undertook the following actions over a period of 3 years and 7 months (from April 2012 to October 2015):
* **In-depth Study of the Existing System:** Conducted a detailed investigation into the functionality, architecture, and internal processes of the already implemented Namos system, including its components, modules, and interactions.
* **Information Gathering:** Liaised with developers, architects, support specialists, and other stakeholders to collect all available information about the system.
* **Performed Architectural Audit:** Conducted an analysis of the system's current architecture to assess compliance with best practices, identify potential bottlenecks, risks, and optimization opportunities.
* **Developed and Structured Documentation:** Created comprehensive technical and architectural documentation for the Namos system using the Confluence platform. The documentation covered all aspects of the system, including functional and non-functional requirements, architectural decisions, user scenarios, integration rules, etc.
* **Ensured Standards Compliance:** Paid particular attention to ensuring that all developed documentation complied with applicable local and European standards, which was critical for the client.
* **Interaction and Agreement:** Continuously collaborated with Wincor Nixdorf representatives to align on the developed documentation and obtain confirmation of its accuracy and completeness.

### Result
As a result of my work, the client gained:
* **An Architectural Audit of the Namos System was Performed:** Wincor Nixdorf received an independent assessment of the architecture of its key petrol station management system, allowing for the identification of potential improvements.
* **Complete and Up-to-Date Software Documentation:** Comprehensive and standardized documentation for the existing Namos system was created.
* **Documentation Compliance with Local and European Standards:** Adherence to regulatory and industry requirements was ensured, enhancing the system's legitimacy and usability in various markets.
* **Improved System Manageability and Transparency:** The availability of standardized documentation significantly simplified system support, future development, and integration, as well as reduced risks associated with a lack of information.
* **Enhanced Communication Between Teams:** Clear documentation facilitated interaction among different teams working with the system.
