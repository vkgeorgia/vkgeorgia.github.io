## Project: RTK-DMP â€“ Data Management Platform (DMP)

**Industry:** Telecom
**Domain:** Data Management, Digital Marketing
**Employer:** Rostelecom
**Client:** Rostelecom
**Project Code:** RTK-DMP
**Start Date:** Jul 2017
**End Date:** Jul 2019
**Role(s):** Solution Architect
**Key Result:** Architecture for a DMP was created and a business-driving implementation was proposed, which allowed the company to launch several new profitable businesses and get a foundation for building a business for years to come.

### Situation
Rostelecom, the largest provider of communication services in Russia, offering wired and mobile telephony, cable and wireless internet, receives a massive amount of valuable data from providing these services. This data had huge potential for creating new services and increasing profit.

### Task
It was decided to analyze this data and provide a suite of services based on it for both internal and external clients. For this, the Data Lab team (Project #18) was created, and to support the Data Lab's work, a corresponding infrastructure (both hardware and software) was needed to effectively process and store this data.

### Actions
I undertook the following actions over a period of 2 years (from July 2017 to July 2019):
* **Stakeholder Interaction:** I conducted a series of meetings with stakeholders from the Data Lab team who were going to work with the data, as well as with data suppliers and consumers.
* **Requirements Gathering:** I gathered their requirements, along with integration, functional, and non-functional requirements.
* **Architectural Documentation:** I created an architectural document containing a description of the future solution, starting from the concept, then the business architecture, and down to the information and data layer. The document described the logic for building the Data Management Platform (DMP).
* **Recommendations:** I proposed and justified the architecture of the solution and its implementation.

### Result
As a result of my work:
* **Foundation for Implementation was Created:** The architectural document was handed over for implementation, and the organization began the project to implement the system.
* **New Businesses Launched:** The system had the potential to launch several new profitable businesses for the company, such as segmentation for targeted advertising, contextual advertising, event-based advertising, a recommendation system for online stores and its own streaming service, and many others.
* **Long-term Strategy:** This gave the company a clear roadmap and a foundation for building a profitable business for years to come.
