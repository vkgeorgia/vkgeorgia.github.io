**Industry:** Oil & Gas
**Domain:** Business Intelligence & Data Management
**Employer:** Rostelecom.Restream
**Client:** Gazprom Neft
**Project Code:** RTK-LAKE
**Start Date:** Nov 2016
**End Date:** Nov 2018
**Role(s):** Business Analyst
**Key Result:** Successfully conducted a presale for a large oil and gas enterprise, including analyzing customer requirements, proposing and presenting a solution, and defending it in a competition.

### Situation
Gazprom Neft faced a pressing need for the efficient storage and analysis of massive, heterogeneous datasets related to fuel supplies and sales, as well as associated products. Existing systems struggled with this volume and variety, hindering the extraction of valuable business insights and impeding the discovery of new profit growth opportunities.

### Task
In my role as a Business Analyst, my primary task was to conduct a presale for Gazprom Neft on the concept of a "Data Lake." This involved analyzing customer requirements, developing and proposing an optimal solution, presenting it, and successfully defending it in a competitive tender. The ultimate aim of the proposed Data Lake solution was to help Gazprom Neft uncover additional profit growth opportunities through insights gained from comprehensive processing of this big data.

### Actions
To achieve these goals, I undertook the following actions over a period of 2 years (from November 2016 to November 2018):
* **Deep Customer Needs Analysis:** Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Gazprom Neft's business processes and existing systems to identify key data needs, challenges with current storage, and expectations for a "Data Lake." Special attention was paid to data regarding fuel supplies, sales, and related products.
* **Developed Data Lake Solution Concept:** Based on the identified requirements, I developed a detailed "Data Lake" solution concept, including architecture (data sources, loading methods, storage, processing, consumption), technology stack, and potential business cases for the oil and gas industry.
* **Prepared Technical and Commercial Proposal:** Compiled a comprehensive technical and commercial proposal outlining the proposed solution, its benefits, implementation phases, and estimated costs.
* **Prepared and Delivered Presentation:** Developed presentation materials and conducted a series of presentations of the solution for various levels of Gazprom Neft's management and technical specialists, emphasizing business value and technological advantages.
* **Defended Solution in Tender:** Actively participated in tender procedures, including preparing responses to questions, clarifying solution details, and defending it before the tender commission, demonstrating a deep understanding of client needs and expertise in the proposed area.
* **Collaborated with Experts:** Engaged technical experts and architects for in-depth design and to answer complex technical questions during the presale phase.
* **Formulated Value Proposition:** Prepared arguments for ROI (Return on Investment) and business benefits that the "Data Lake" could bring to the client, such as improved analytics, cost reduction, and accelerated processes.

### Result
As a result of my work:
* **A Successful Presale was Conducted:** Comprehensive presale work was carried out, allowing Rostelecom.Restream to effectively present its competencies and solution.
* **Customer Requirements were Analyzed in Detail:** A deep understanding of Gazprom Neft's needs was ensured, which is critical for developing a relevant solution.

* **The Solution was Successfully Presented and Defended in a Tender:** Demonstrating expertise and preparing compelling arguments contributed to winning the competitive selection.
* **A Foundation for a Potential Implementation Project was Laid:** The presale results created favorable conditions for securing a contract for the full-scale implementation of the Data Lake for Gazprom Neft.
