## Project: RTK-DL – Data Lab

**Industry:** Telecom
**Domain:** Data Analytics, Digital Marketing
**Employer:** Rostelecom
**Client:** Rostelecom
**Project Code:** RTK-DL
**Start Date:** Feb 2017
**End Date:** Feb 2019
**Role(s):** Business Architect
**Key Result:** A new subdivision was created to handle data for the marketing department. The data includes consumer behavior. Tools for behavior analysis, segmentation, omnichannel communication, and a recommendation system were created.

### Situation
Restream, a subsidiary of Rostelecom—a major provider of wired and wireless internet and communication services—faced the need to analyze vast amounts of data from clients, such as visited websites, user interests, and web behavior. The goal was to more accurately target advertisements, react to user churn in a timely manner, and gain other marketing advantages.

### Task
In my role as a Business Analyst and later as an Enterprise Architect, I was tasked with developing the concept for a new data analysis subdivision. The task included: designing the concept for its operation, defining the necessary tools, technologies, and processes for this department, and establishing its goals, objectives, and methods for evaluating its results.

### Actions
I undertook the following actions over a period of 2 years (from February 2017 to February 2019):
* **Developed Subdivision Concept:** I designed a detailed concept for the new subdivision, including its goals, tasks, organizational structure, and functions.
* **Presented Solution to Stakeholders:** I presented the subdivision's goals, tasks, necessary tools, and technologies (Hadoop, Data Lake) to the architectural committee and key stakeholders.
* **Developed Tools and Processes:** I developed concepts for tools for behavior analysis, segmentation, omnichannel communication, and a recommendation system.
* **Developed Metrics and Evaluation Methods:** I established methods for evaluating the quality and success of this subdivision's work, as well as a list of expected outcomes.
* **Collaborated with Teams:** I worked to ensure that data that was previously deemed unnecessary could be used effectively.

### Result
As a result of my work:
* **A New Subdivision was Created:** Based on my proposal, Rostelecom created a new subdivision consisting of analysts, project managers, and technical specialists.
* **Previously Untapped Data Utilized:** The company successfully began analyzing data that was previously left unused and now uses it for business purposes.
* **Foundation for New Profitable Products:** The work of this subdivision provided the foundation for launching a whole range of new, profitable company products, such as targeted advertising, a recommendation system, a churn reaction system, traffic filtering, redirects, and much more.
* **Enhanced Marketing Effectiveness:** The company's marketing capabilities expanded significantly, allowing for more precise audience targeting.
