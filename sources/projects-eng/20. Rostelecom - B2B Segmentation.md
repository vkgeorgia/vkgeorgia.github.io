**Industry:** Telecom
**Domain:** Communication & Marketing
**Employer:** Rostelecom
**Client:** Rostelecom
**Project Code:** RTK-B2B
**Start Date:** Apr 2017
**End Date:** Apr 2019
**Role(s):** Solution Architect, Business Analyst
**Key Result:** Architecture for a multi-channel communication system for B2B interaction was developed. Documentation was handed over for implementation, which led to increased additional sales and customer satisfaction.

### Situation
Rostelecom had problems with communications with client organizations. There was no system that allowed for mailings to a specific segment of business consumers. It was assumed that creating such a system would enable targeted mailings and increase sales opportunities to existing clients.

### Task
In my role as Solution Architect and Business Analyst, my task was to conduct a survey, understand the current situation, take into account the opinions of stakeholders, and design a system that could solve the described problems.

### Actions
I undertook the following actions over a period of 2 years (from April 2017 to April 2019):
* **Conducted Interviews:** I conducted interviews with numerous interested parties from different departments to gather existing information and identify needs.
* **Identified and Formalized Rules:** I identified and formalized the rules for how to segment message recipients, how to obtain information for mailings, how to approve it, and how to send it to clients.
* **Created a Solution Architecture:** After that, I created the solution architecture for a multi-channel communication system that could implement these rules.
* **Prepared Documentation and Handed Over for Development:** I prepared complete documentation on the system requirements and handed it over for development.

### Result
As a result of my work:
* **A Clear Action Plan was Received:** The company received a clear action plan to solve the existing problem.
* **Reduced Implementation Costs:** The clear and understandable description reduced the costs of implementing the solution.
* **Increased Additional Sales:** After implementation, the company gained the ability to target mailings to groups of consumers and thus increased additional sales.
* **Increased Customer Satisfaction:** The improvement in the quality of communications and targeted mailings led to an increase in customer satisfaction.
