### Situation
Rostelecom.SkyLink, as a telecommunications company with multiple legal entities, faced challenges in unifying its accounting and inventory management. The lack of an integrated system led to disparate data, difficulties in generating consolidated reports, and hindered integration with other internal planning systems, thereby reducing overall operational efficiency and transparency.

### Task
In my dual role as Business Analyst and Project Manager, my task was to deploy and configure an integrated accounting system (1C: Accounting + Trade & Warehouse). The goal was to unify accounting and inventory management across all legal entities of the company, ensure transparent reporting, and enable integration with existing planning systems.

### Actions
To achieve these goals, I undertook the following actions over a period of 2 years (from August 2008 to August 2010):
* **Analyzed Current Processes:** Conducted a detailed analysis of the existing accounting and warehouse management processes across all legal entities of the company.
* **Gathered and Analyzed Requirements:** Collaborated with key stakeholders (accounting, logistics, management) to gather and formalize requirements for the new integrated system.
* **Designed and Configured the System:** Developed the functional specification and oversaw the configuration of the 1C: Accounting and 1C: Trade & Warehouse system in accordance with the identified requirements and specificities of all legal entities.
* **Managed Project and Team:** As Project Manager, I was responsible for planning, coordinating, and controlling all project phases, including development, testing, data migration, and implementation. I led the team, ensuring adherence to timelines and quality standards.
* **Unified Data and Processes:** Worked on unifying accounting policies and procedures across all legal entities to ensure data consistency in the new system.
* **Integration:** Planned and oversaw the integration efforts of the new system with the company's existing planning systems.
* **Training and Support:** Organized user training for the new system and provided necessary support during the implementation phase.

### Result

* **An Integrated Accounting System was Implemented:** The 1C: Accounting + Trade & Warehouse system was successfully deployed and configured, allowing for centralized management of accounting and inventory.
