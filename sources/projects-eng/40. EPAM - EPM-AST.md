## Project: EPM-AST – Private Blockchain POC – National Stablecoin

**Industry:** Finance
**Employer:** EPAM
**Client:** Bank, Integrator
**Project Code:** EPM-AST
**Start Date:** Apr 2025
**End Date:** May 2025
**Role(s):** Enterprise Architect
**Key Result:** A solution designed to meet requirements and constraints, along with a roadmap for future changes, was delivered to the Client, leading to the start of the implementation project.

### Situation
This project was a **Proof of Concept (POC)** for a leading bank in Asia. The bank faced the need to establish **proof of concept for a national stablecoin currency** based on a private blockchain. This required rapid validation of the idea and demonstration of technical feasibility.

### Task
In my role as an Enterprise Architect, the key task was to **gather requirements** for a private blockchain system for a national stablecoin, **create a solution concept**, and provide the Client with a **clear roadmap** for the next steps towards implementation.

### Actions
To achieve these goals, I undertook the following actions during the project (from April 2025 to May 2025):
* **Requirements Gathering:** I actively collaborated with stakeholders from the bank and the integrator to collect and clarify all functional and non-functional requirements for the private blockchain system and the national stablecoin.
* **Solution Concept Development:** Based on the gathered requirements, I prepared a detailed solution concept, outlining the architecture, key components, and operating principles of the private blockchain, as well as the mechanisms for issuing and circulating the stablecoin. This concept was agreed upon with the Client.
* **Activity Prioritization and Roadmap Creation:** I conducted activities to prioritize subsequent actions, defining key stages and tasks for full-scale implementation. Based on this, a **clear roadmap** was developed, indicating where and how to proceed.

### Result
As a result of my work:
* **Client Received Developed Solution:** The bank was provided with a **detailed and agreed-upon solution**, taking into account all identified requirements and constraints for the private blockchain and stablecoin POC.
* **Roadmap for Future Changes Provided:** The client received a **clear roadmap** for subsequent implementation phases, which provided strategic vision for the project.
* **Implementation Project Started:** The successful completion of the POC and the provision of the roadmap led to the **initiation of the full-scale implementation project**, confirming the value of the proposed solution.
