**Industry:** Transport
**Domain:** Strategic Management, Enterprise Architecture, Organizational Change Management
**Employer:** DME Airport
**Client:** DME Airport
**Project Code:** DME-29
**Start Date:** Feb 2021
**End Date:** Aug 2021
**Role(s):** Enterprise Architect
**Key Result:** The IT subsidiary (DI) gained the ability to work with external clients. New methodologies for change management (TOGAF) and software development (Agile) were implemented. The foundation was laid for improving the department's image and increasing profitability.

### Situation
The Domodedovo Integration (DI) IT department suffered from outdated working methods and technologies, leading to low efficiency and unprofitability. The department's image among IT specialists was poor, making it difficult to attract talented personnel who sought modern working conditions, flexible methodologies like Agile, and an innovative environment. This resulted in a severe talent shortage and the use of outdated technologies.

### Task
My primary task was twofold:
**Strategic:** Create a corporate IT strategy fully aligned with the airport's business goals and conduct a comprehensive reorganization of the IT department to enhance its efficiency and adaptability. The goal was to improve its image to attract talent, ensure profitability, and implement a modern methodology for change management and software development.
**Operational:** Assess the current IT landscape, organize workshops, map IT capabilities to business needs, and propose an IT development roadmap.

### Actions
I undertook the following actions over a period of seven months (from February to August 2021):
* **Strategic Reorganization and Methodology Implementation:** I actively participated in the reorganization of the IT department, optimizing its structure and processes. I developed the IT strategy based on the TOGAF methodology and implemented Agile principles into the department's work, ensuring modern management and development approaches.
* **IT Landscape Assessment:** I conducted an assessment of the current IT landscape and mapped the IT capabilities to business needs.
* **Roadmap and Strategy Development:** Based on my findings, I proposed an IT development roadmap and developed the IT strategy to be fully aligned with the airport's business goals.
* **Workshops and Training:** I organized and conducted workshops with key stakeholders and prepared training materials to facilitate a quick start to development using the Scrum methodology.

### Result
My work resulted in the following outcomes:
* **Strategic Alignment:** The airport received a clear, actionable IT strategy integrated with the overall business strategy. The TOGAF-based IT strategy and Agile implementation significantly enhanced the strategic value and operational efficiency of the IT department.
* **New Revenue Streams:** The IT subsidiary (DI) gained the ability to work with external clients, opening new revenue streams.
* **Improved Image and Talent Acquisition:** Through reorganization and the implementation of modern practices, the foundation was laid for improving the department's image, attracting qualified IT specialists, and increasing profitability.
* **Modernized Operations:** The company adopted a new, modern methodology for working with changes based on TOGAF and a software development methodology based on Agile.
