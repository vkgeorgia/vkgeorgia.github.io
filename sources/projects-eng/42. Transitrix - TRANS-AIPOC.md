## Project: TRANS-AIPOC – AI Agent-Based Process Automation Proof-of-Concept

**Industry:** AI Consulting
**Employer:** Transitrix
**Client:** A client in the AI Consulting sector
**Project Code:** TRANS-AIPOC
**Start Date:** Apr 2025
**End Date:** Sep 2025
**Role(s):** Enterprise Architect
**Key Result:** Successfully demonstrated the practical applicability and value of automating the Product Development Process based on AI agents, leading to negotiations for full-scale implementation.

### Situation
The client faced significant challenges in their Product Development Process (PDP) – the process for launching new confectionery products for the European market, as well as modernizing, modifying, or retiring existing ones. This process was extremely lengthy and unpredictable due to its complex, iterative nature and numerous interactions across various enterprise functions. This led to delays in market entry for new products and difficulties in managing the product lifecycle.

### Task
In my role as Enterprise Architect, my task was to demonstrate to the client the value of automating their critical Product Development Process using AI agents. The goal was to showcase the potential for significant process time reduction, increased predictability, and enhanced transparency through analytics. The ultimate deliverable was a working Proof-of-Concept (POC) that would validate the viability and effectiveness of this approach.

### Actions
To accomplish this task, which spanned six months (from April to September 2025), I undertook the following actions:
* **Detailed Target Process Modeling:** I meticulously modeled and gained client agreement on the target state of the Product Development Process, mapping out complex workflows, iterations, and interactions.
* **Identification of AI Agent Automation Segments:** Based on the modeled process, I identified specific fragments and activities that could be effectively automated using intelligent agents.
* **AI Agent Technical Specification Development:** I prepared a detailed technical specification outlining the operational logic of each AI agent, their functions, interactions, and behavioral requirements.
* **Selection and Application of Advanced Technologies:** For the POC development, I utilized leading multi-agent frameworks: Crew AI and MS Autogen.
* **Development of a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System:** In the second phase of the project, I developed a functional RAG system for storing and retrieving organizational knowledge about the process.
    * **RAG Functionality:** Converts user queries into vector representations (OpenAI embeddings), searches a PostgreSQL database for documents with similar vectors (cosine similarity), gathers top matching documents to form context for the LLM (via LangChain/OpenAI), generates a relevant answer, and returns the answer with metadata.
    * **Key Technologies Used for RAG:** FastAPI, LangChain & OpenAI, psycopg2, numpy, python-dotenv, uv.
* **POC Demonstration:** I organized and conducted a demonstration of the working Proof-of-Concept, showcasing the automated process segments and the capabilities of the RAG system.

### Result
As a result of my work, the client received:
* **A Working Proof-of-Concept (POC) with Agent-Based Architecture:** The practical applicability and value of automating the Product Development Process using AI agents were successfully demonstrated.
* **Confirmed Potential for Process Acceleration:** The POC showed the potential to reduce product development time by up to 5 times, which is critically important for the client's market competitiveness.
* **Foundation for Process Analytics:** The project demonstrated the feasibility of creating an analytical system that allows tracking each product at every development stage, enhancing process transparency and manageability.
* **Client Engagement and Buy-in:** The client was highly impressed by the demonstrated capabilities, leading to negotiations for full-scale implementation of the developed approach.
* **Technical Foundation for Scalability:** The designed architectural solutions and the RAG system established a robust technical foundation for further development and scaling of the system within the organization.
