## Project: BTC-ARCO (2) â€“ Product Domain Transformation

**Industry:** Telecom
**Employer:** EPAM
**Client:** BTC
**Project Code:** BTC-ARCO (2)
**Start Date:** Sept 2024
**End Date:** Mar 2025
**Role(s):** Product Domain Architect
**Key Result:** Reorganized product domain, created plan, initiated vendor selection.

### Situation
BTC, a telecom company, continued its transformation into a digital services marketplace and faced a series of critical challenges in its product domain.
* **Focus on Telecom Services:** The company was solely focused on traditional telecom services, lacking a clear development plan for product line management and sales growth.
* **Customer Service Issues:** Problems were encountered in providing services to customers. The product line was too long and cluttered, making it difficult to find products and services at the point of sale and complicating the buyer's decision regarding the product.
* **Concept Blending:** Each Product Variant was entered into the Catalogue as a separate Offer, essentially mixing the concepts of Product and Offer into one.
* **Outdated Product Catalogue:** The product catalogue could not be updated in a timely manner, and Product Managers could not change or add Products to the Catalogue.
* **Lack of Partner Support:** There was no possibility of working with partner products or onboarding Partners and their Products, and there was no self-service option for partners.
* **Catalogue Compilation Challenges:** Compiling a Catalogue from various sources, such as business domains and partners, was impossible.
* **Inflexible Product Management:** There was no possibility of flexible product configuration or creating collections and bundles.
* **Inflexible Price Management:** There was no possibility of flexible price management, definition, or automatic application of business rules.
* **Low Domain Maturity:** The company's overall maturity in the product domain was low.
All these issues necessitated a rework of the product domain architecture to support partner products, bundling, and improved overall product management within an expanding ecosystem.

### Task
In my role as Product Domain Architect, the task was to develop a concept and roadmap for the product domain that would be aligned with the company's overall business strategy and other domain architectures, to overcome existing challenges and support the transformation into a digital services marketplace.

### Actions
I undertook the following actions over a period of 7 months (from September 2024 to March 2025):
* **Current State Assessment:** Conducted a comprehensive assessment of the product domain's current state, including an analysis of the problems the company faced (focus on telecom services, unclear product line development plan, customer service issues due to a cluttered product line, mixing Product/Offer concepts, outdated catalogue, lack of partner support, catalogue compilation difficulties, inflexible product management and pricing, low domain maturity).
* **Proposed Quick Fixes:** Developed and proposed "quick fixes" to improve the immediate situation within the domain.
* **Created Domain Concept:** Developed a new concept for the product domain, aligned with the company's strategic goals as a digital services marketplace.
* **Described Capability Model:** Detailed the capability model for various solution options.
* **Proposed Target Architecture:** Designed the target architecture for various product domain solution options, accounting for support of partner products, bundling, and improved product management.
* **Developed Change Plan:** Formulated a detailed change plan for implementing the new product domain architecture and aligned this plan with activities across the entire enterprise landscape.
* **Conducted Market Study and Vendor Information Collection:** Conducted a market study, collected, and analyzed information from solution vendors, which will be useful when choosing a vendor for the final solution.
* **Initiated Vendor Selection Procedures:** Launched the procedure for collecting information from vendors for "Catalogue" and "Marketplace" solutions.

### Result
As a result of my work:
* **An Actionable Domain Development Roadmap was Delivered:** The client received a clear and implementable plan for product domain development, aligned with the company's strategy.
* **Procurement Processes Initiated for Key Solutions:** The vendor selection process for critical systems (Catalogue and Marketplace) was launched, representing a key step towards implementing architectural changes.
* **Transformation to Marketplace Supported:** An architectural foundation was created, enabling BTC to effectively manage a wide range of products and services, including partner offerings and bundles.
* **Improved Product Manageability:** The groundwork was laid for more effective and flexible management of the company's product portfolio.
* **Enhanced Understanding of Current Problems and Solutions:** The detailed analysis of the current situation and the proposed concepts provided BTC with a clear understanding of their product landscape and the steps for its modernization.
