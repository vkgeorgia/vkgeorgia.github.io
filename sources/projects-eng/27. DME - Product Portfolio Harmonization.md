## Project: DME-27 â€“ Product Portfolio Harmonization and Product Development Process Reengineering

**Industry:** Transport
**Domain:** Enterprise Architecture, Product Management, OCM
**Employer:** DME Airport
**Client:** DME Airport
**Project Code:** DME-27
**Start Date:** Nov 2019
**End Date:** Feb 2021
**Role(s):** Enterprise Architect
**Key Result:** The product portfolio was reduced from 4,600 to 1,200 products without compromising profitability. Time-to-Market (TTM) reduced by 3 times. "Profit-per-Product" indicator significantly increased.

### Situation
Moscow Domodedovo Airport's product portfolio was highly inefficient. It consisted of 4,600 products without detailed classification, leading to duplication, functional overlap, and outdated positions. The airport lacked a cohesive product strategy or roadmap, and its product management and regulatory systems were outdated, hindering effective business operations.

### Task
My task was two-fold:
**Strategic:** Maximize the "**profit-per-product**" indicator and enhance the overall efficiency of the product portfolio by creating a structured approach to product development and management.
**Operational:** Harmonize the portfolio, eliminate inefficiencies, and update the product management and regulatory systems.

### Actions
I undertook the following actions over a period of 16 months (from November 2019 to February 2021):
* **Strategic Analysis:** I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the existing product portfolio. I then developed a detailed classification system, a robust product strategy, and roadmaps. I also implemented advanced analytics to support data-driven decision-making.
* **Portfolio Harmonization:** I led the effort to eliminate duplication and functional overlap within the product portfolio, reducing its size from 4,600 to 1,200 products.
* **System Modernization:** I updated and modernized the product management and regulatory systems to improve efficiency and support the new product strategy.
* **Organizational Change Management:** I created training materials and a methodology for product managers to work with, ensuring a consistent approach across all 19 legal entities of the airport.

### Result
As a result of my work:
* **Portfolio Optimization:** The product portfolio was successfully optimized, reduced from 4,600 to 1,200 products without compromising overall profitability.
* **Increased Efficiency:** The **Time-to-Market (TTM)** for new products was reduced by **three times**, allowing the company to respond more quickly to market demands.
* **Enhanced Profitability:** The **"Profit-per-Product"** indicator significantly increased due to the elimination of inefficient products and the focus on high-value offerings.
* **Standardized Processes:** The implementation of a new methodology and training ensured a consistent and efficient product management process across the airport's legal entities.
