**Industry:** IT Services
**Domain:** Enterprise Architecture, Data Management
**Employer:** EPAM
**Client:** EPAM
**Project Code:** EPM-PSR, EPM-ECO
**Start Date:** Mar 2022
**End Date:** Oct 2022
**Role(s):** Enterprise Architect
**Key Result:** Client profile architecture was developed, profile storage prepared, and data migration successfully completed, accounting for dynamic system changes and format transformations, leading to active integration by consuming systems.

### Situation
Following the completion of the previous project (Project #31), which established the **Unified Client Profile Concept**, there was a critical need to practically implement this concept. The company required specialized **profile storage** capable of consolidating data from various sources and providing centralized access to unified client information.

### Task
My task, as an Enterprise Architect, was to **create the client profile storage**, which included developing its architecture, migrating data from existing systems, and establishing clear rules for its operation and interaction. The project demanded meticulous work on data architecture, accounting for dynamic changes in source systems, and transforming various data formats.

### Actions
During the project, which ran from March to October 2022, I took the following actions:
* **Team Assembly and Organization:** As a Lead Business Analyst, I assembled and organized the work of the analyst team, fostering effective collaboration to achieve project goals.
* **Requirements Gathering and Conceptualization:** We conducted comprehensive requirements gathering for the profile storage, engaging with various stakeholders. Based on the insights gained, a detailed concept for the storage was developed.
* **Rule and Data Architecture Development:** Significant attention was given to establishing operational rules for the storage, creating an optimal data architecture, and defining requirements for the data migration process. This involved addressing dynamic changes in source systems and transforming diverse data formats.
* **Migration Preparation:** Plans and procedures for data migration were developed and agreed upon, ensuring the integrity and quality of the transferred information.

### Result
As a result of our work:
* **A Centralized Data Storage was Created:** The company gained a functional and scalable **client profile storage**.
* **Active Integration by Consuming Systems Began:** Various consuming systems started connecting to the new profile storage, confirming its demand and central role in the company's data ecosystem.
* **A Foundation for Future Growth was Established:** The project laid a strong foundation for the continued development and expansion of the storage's functionality, as more systems continue to connect, indicating its success and adaptability.
