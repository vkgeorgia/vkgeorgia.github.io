**Industry:** Oil & Gas
**Employer:** OilPC
**Client:** Gazprom Neft
**Project Code:** OILPC-LOY
**Start Date:** Feb 2012
**End Date:** Aug 2015
**Role(s):** Business Analyst, Project Manager, Solution Architect
**Key Result:** Designed and launched a loyalty system for the fuel retail chain. Implemented a comprehensive loyalty program platform. Participants grew from 1M to 4.5M; marketing effectiveness significantly improved.

### Situation
Gazprom Neft's fuel retail chain faced the need to enhance customer loyalty and increase the effectiveness of its marketing campaigns. It likely lacked a centralized and efficient loyalty program, which made it difficult to retain customers, personalize offers, and track marketing ROI. Existing mechanisms, if any, were insufficient to effectively grow the loyal customer base and influence their purchasing behavior.

### Task
In my roles as Business Analyst, Project Manager, and Solution Architect, my task was to design and launch a comprehensive loyalty system for Gazprom Neft's fuel retail chain. The goal was to create and implement a full-fledged loyalty program platform capable of significantly increasing participant numbers and improving marketing effectiveness.

### Actions
To achieve these goals, I undertook the following actions over a period of 3 years and 7 months (from February 2012 to August 2015):
* **Analyzed Market Practices and Business Needs:** Researched best practices in loyalty programs within retail (including fuel retail) and conducted a detailed analysis of Gazprom Neft's business needs regarding customer retention and increasing average transaction value.
* **Gathered and Formalized Requirements:** Collaborated with stakeholders from various departments (marketing, sales, IT, finance) to gather and detail functional and non-functional requirements for the loyalty system.
* **Designed Solution Architecture:** As Solution Architect, I developed a comprehensive architecture for the loyalty program platform, including modules for participant registration, points/bonus accrual and redemption, offer personalization, campaign management, and integration with POS systems at gas stations and CRM systems. Development utilized Java, PHP, and Oracle DB technologies.
* **Managed Development and Implementation Project:** In my role as Project Manager, I organized and led a multidisciplinary team, responsible for planning, resource management, budget, timelines, and quality for the entire project.
* **Developed and Implemented the Platform:** Oversaw the development, testing, and deployment of all components of the loyalty platform.
* **Launched Loyalty Program:** Organized the pilot and then full-scale launch of the loyalty program across the fuel retail chain, including developing program rules, communication materials, and training gas station staff.
* **Implemented Analytics Tools:** Developed and implemented tools for collecting and analyzing data on loyalty program participant behavior, which allowed for tracking the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

### Result
As a result of my work, the client gained:
* **A Comprehensive Loyalty System Designed and Successfully Launched:** A centralized platform supporting all aspects of the loyalty program for the fuel retail chain was created and implemented.
* **Significant Growth in Participant Base:** The number of loyalty program participants grew from 1 million to 4.5 million, indicating the program's high attractiveness and effective customer acquisition.
* **Significantly Improved Marketing Effectiveness:** Thanks to personalization, segmentation, and results tracking capabilities, marketing campaigns became more targeted and impactful.
* **Increased Customer Loyalty and Retention:** The program helped strengthen customer relationships and encourage repeat purchases.
* **Data Availability for Decision-Making:** The ability to analyze customer behavior data emerged, allowing for further optimization of marketing strategies and product offerings.
