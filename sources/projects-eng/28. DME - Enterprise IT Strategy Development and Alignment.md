### Situation
Moscow Domodedovo Airport lacked a cohesive IT strategy that effectively supported the company's future growth. The challenge was ensuring that the IT department's plans aligned with the airport's overall business goals. With my strong IT background, I was brought in to lead the development of the airport's IT strategy and held the position of Head of IT Strategy.

### Task
My primary tasks were to **create a cohesive IT strategy** that effectively supported the airport's overall business goals and to ensure the projection of strategic IT initiatives into specific IT department strategies. This required close alignment between the IT strategy and the overall enterprise vision.

### Actions
Over a period of seven months (from February to August 2021), I took the following actions:
* **Strategic Alignment:** I worked on aligning high-level enterprise IT goals with the operational plans and strategies of individual IT departments, ensuring their close interconnectedness and mutual support.
* **Enterprise Architecture Development:** I was responsible for developing the **enterprise architecture**.
* **Vendor and Solution Selection:** I conducted negotiations with key vendors (such as SITA, Amadeus, Fujitsu, and Wincor Nixdorf), performed vendor comparisons and selections, and made solution selections to ensure alignment with our strategic goals.

### Result
My work resulted in the creation of a **cohesive IT strategy** that effectively supported the airport's overall business goals, ensuring strategic alignment across different levels of IT management. The developed **enterprise architecture** along with the selected vendors and solutions laid the foundation for future technological transformations.
