## Project: ADNO-TRMS â€“ AI-Enabled Remuneration Process Transformation

**Industry:** Oil and Gas
**Employer:** EPAM Systems
**Client:** Vertically Integrated Oil and Gas Company
**Project Code:** ADNO-TRMS
**Start Date:** Jun 2025
**End Date:** Jul 2025
**Role(s):** Lead Business Analyst
**Key Result:** The organization received a ready-to-implement target process description and AI agent requirements, prepared for the deployment of a new AI-automated process.

### Situation
The client, a vertically integrated oil and gas company, aimed to significantly overhaul and optimize their existing process for planning and calculating fixed and variable remunerations. The current process was likely inefficient, time-consuming, prone to errors, and carried human-factor risks, including potential for corruption in bonus and incentive payouts.

### Task
In my role as Lead Business Analyst, my primary task was to redesign the remuneration planning and calculation process, transforming it into an optimized, target-state model. A critical aspect of this task was to identify and design specific process segments that could be enhanced or automated using Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. My role also encompassed organizing team efforts, selecting the appropriate methodology, facilitating all necessary workshops, and producing all required project documentation. A key metric was a projected tenfold reduction in process time (from 11 weeks to 1-2 weeks).

### Actions
To achieve these objectives, I undertook the following actions over a period of 2 months (from June to July 2025):
* **Research and Best Practices Integration:** I thoroughly researched industry best practices and recommendations from leading consulting agencies regarding remuneration processes, leveraging insights from EPAM's past projects and expert advice.
* **Stakeholder Engagement and Requirements Gathering:** I organized and led a series of meetings with approximately 10 key stakeholders from various departments across the client organization to gain a deep understanding of their current process challenges, pain points, and expectations for the future system.
* **Solution Concept Development:** Based on the analysis of best practices and stakeholder input, I developed a comprehensive conceptual framework for the new remuneration process.
* **Capability Analysis and Business Architecture Design:** I utilized capability analysis to construct the target business architecture for the process, identifying the essential business capabilities needed to achieve the desired outcomes.
* **Target Process Design:** I meticulously designed the detailed target-state process for remuneration planning and calculation, seamlessly integrating best practices, client requirements, and our accumulated expertise.
* **AI-Ready Process Engineering:** Crucially, the process was designed from the ground up to be "AI-ready," ensuring that key activities within the process could be easily automated by future AI agents.
* **AI Agent Specification Development:** For each identified part of the process suitable for AI application, I created detailed descriptions of the respective AI agents' functionalities, outlining their roles, input/output data, and interaction logic.
* **Work Organization and Leadership:** In my capacity as Lead Business Analyst, I was responsible for the overall organization of the work, selecting the appropriate analysis and design approach, and coordinating all project activities.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:** I prepared a complete set of project documents, including the target process description, AI agent requirements, and other necessary artifacts.

### Result
As a result of my work, the client received:
* **A Fully Designed Target Process Description:** A detailed, optimized, and agreed-upon process for remuneration planning and calculation, aligned with best practices and the company's specific needs.
* **Ready-to-Implement AI Agent Requirements:** Detailed specifications for the deployment of AI agents, enabling the automation of significant portions of the process.
* **Preparedness for Implementation:** The organization is now fully prepared to implement the new, AI-automated process.
* **Significant Business Impact:** The project laid the foundation for achieving substantial benefits:
    * **Drastic Time Savings:** The process, which currently takes 11 weeks, is projected to be reduced to 1-2 weeks in the new model, representing up to a tenfold reduction in processing time.
    * **Reduced Errors:** Minimization of human error and automation of routine operations.
    * **Decreased Human Involvement:** Freeing employees from repetitive tasks.
    * **Mitigation of Corruption Risks:** Automation of calculations and payouts significantly reduces opportunities for abuse.
    * **Numerous other direct and indirect business effects** enhancing process transparency and efficiency.
