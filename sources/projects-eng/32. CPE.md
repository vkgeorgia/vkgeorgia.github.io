## Project: EPM-PSR – Central Permission Engine (CPE)

**Industry:** IT Services
**Domain:** Enterprise Architecture
**Employer:** EPAM
**Client:** EPAM
**Project Code:** EPM-PSR
**Start Date:** Mar 2022
**End Date:** Oct 2022
**Role(s):** Enterprise Architect
**Key Result:** A concept for a centralized permission model was formulated, allowing for access rights to be assigned based on both role-based and resource-based models.

### Situation
The company had numerous systems for internal and external use. Both company employees and external participants—such as students and subcontractors—could use the systems. Furthermore, the information used by the company also required access restrictions. In the current state, access management was decentralized and handled separately in each system and each business process.

### Task
To clearly restrict access to company resources, both information resources and IT systems, a single permission management system was required. This was expected to reduce the labor costs of managing access to systems and information.

### Actions
I undertook the following actions over a period of 8 months (from March to October 2022):
* **Information Gathering and Analysis:** I collected information about interested parties and their wishes, as well as the current state of processes and systems.
* **Target System Design:** Together with the solution architect, I developed the target state of the system.
* **Requirements Formalization:** I formalized the requirements and handed them over for development.

### Result
As a result of my work:
* **A Single Permission Management Engine was Created:** The company received a single permission management engine with flexible configuration options.
* **Flexible Configuration:** Permissions could be granted based on a role-based or resource-based model, and business and technical rules for permission management could be set.
* **Potential Savings and Risk Reduction:** This system has the potential to save the organization millions of dollars annually and eliminate the risks of unauthorized access to information, thereby improving the company's image as a reliable partner.
