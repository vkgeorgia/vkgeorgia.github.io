**Industry:** Oil & Gas
**Employer:** OilPC
**Client:** Gazprom Neft
**Project Code:** OILPC-KSBR
**Start Date:** Jan 2012
**End Date:** Jul 2015
**Role(s):** Project Manager, Business Analyst, Solution Architect
**Key Result:** Created a platform for cashless settlement. Reduced fraud by replacing paper fuel coupons with cards. Automated cashless settlements with 70,000 legal entities; reduced reconciliation time 6x, cut fraud losses 10x; received a client commendation.

### Situation
Gazprom Neft, a major oil and gas company, faced significant challenges in managing cashless fuel payments with corporate clients. The use of paper fuel coupons was inefficient, prone to fraud, and required substantial manual effort for reconciling transactions with numerous legal entities (70,000+). This led to financial losses, payment delays, and reduced client satisfaction.

### Task
In my roles as Project Manager, Business Analyst, and Solution Architect, my task was to create a platform for cashless settlements that would replace outdated paper coupons with cards. The objective was to automate cashless settlements with over 70,000 legal entities, significantly reduce transaction reconciliation time, and drastically decrease fraud losses.

### Actions
To achieve these goals, I undertook the following actions over a period of 3 years and 7 months (from January 2012 to July 2015):
* **Comprehensive Analysis:** Conducted a detailed analysis of existing cashless payment processes, identifying the main sources of fraud, inefficiencies, and labor costs associated with paper coupons and reconciliation.
* **Requirements Gathering and Formalization:** Collaborated with stakeholders from various Gazprom Neft departments (finance, sales, security, IT) to gather and detail requirements for the new cashless payment system.
* **Designed Solution Architecture:** As Solution Architect, I developed a comprehensive architecture for the CCPS platform, including the design of the card accounting system, security mechanisms, interfaces for legal entities, and integration with existing Gazprom Neft systems. Java, PHP, and Oracle DB were used in development.
* **Managed Development and Implementation Project:** In my role as Project Manager, I organized and led a multidisciplinary team, being responsible for planning, resource management, budget, timelines, and quality throughout the entire project lifecycle.
* **Implemented Card System:** Managed the transition from paper coupons to plastic cards for corporate clients, including processes for card issuance, activation, blocking, and accounting.
* **Automated Settlements and Reconciliation:** Directed the development and implementation of functionalities to automate the processes of accrual, deduction, and reconciliation of cashless payments with legal entities.
* **Implemented Anti-Fraud Mechanisms:** Designed and implemented new mechanisms and algorithms to detect and prevent fraud within the cashless payment system.
* **Testing, Training, and Launch:** Organized thorough system testing, client staff training, and the subsequent launch of the platform into production.

### Result
As a result of my work, the client gained:
* **A Cashless Payment Platform (CCPS) was Created and is Successfully Operating:** The new system replaced the outdated paper coupon method, providing a modern and efficient solution.
* **Automated Settlements with 70,000+ Legal Entities:** This significantly increased the efficiency and scalability of interactions with corporate clients.
* **Reconciliation Time Reduced by 6x:** The routine and labor-intensive task of transaction reconciliation is now performed significantly faster, freeing up resources.
* **Fraud Losses Cut by 10x:** The transition to a card-based system and the implementation of new security mechanisms led to a radical reduction in financial losses related to fraud.
* **Received Client Commendation:** The project was highly praised by Gazprom Neft for its significant business results and increased efficiency.
* **Enhanced Corporate Client Satisfaction:** The convenience and transparency of the new system improved the interaction experience for legal entities.
