## Project: RTK-O2O â€“ O2O Interaction

**Industry:** Telecom
**Domain:** Inter-operator Communication
**Employer:** Rostelecom
**Client:** Rostelecom
**Project Code:** RTK-O2O
**Start Date:** Jun 2017
**End Date:** Jun 2019
**Role(s):** Enterprise Architect
**Key Result:** A concept for interaction architecture between operators was developed. A solution was created. As an alternative, a solution for inter-operator settlement registration based on blockchain was proposed.

### Situation
Rostelecom had very complex relationships with other operators, with companies supplying each other services through intricate schemes that included multilateral offsetting of debts. This led to difficulties with settlement reconciliation, the speed of this reconciliation, and an abundance of paperwork.

### Task
Management tasked me with simplifying the accounting of mutual settlements, accelerating reconciliation, and reducing the number of errors during reconciliation. The goal was to free up additional funds for operational activities and increase the company's overall efficiency.

### Actions
I undertook the following actions over a period of 2 years (from June 2017 to June 2019):
* **Analyzed Partner Interactions:** I held numerous meetings with company stakeholders and partners to understand the complex interaction and settlement scheme.
* **Designed a Target System:** I designed a target system capable of simplifying accounting, accelerating reconciliation, and reducing errors.
* **Aligned the Solution:** I held meetings to align the designed solution with all interested parties.
* **Prepared Documentation:** The documentation was handed over for development.
* **Developed an Alternative Blockchain Solution:** As an additional exercise, I developed a solution variant using blockchain technology, created a POC (Proof of Concept), and demonstrated the advantages of such a solution.

### Result
As a result of my work:
* **A Clear Action Plan:** The company received a clear action plan to solve the problem, as well as an agreed-upon solution that could be launched.
* **Potential Savings:** The potential savings from implementation amounted to thousands of man-hours per year, and the reduction in errors could save the company millions of dollars per year.
* **Increased Efficiency:** The simplification of accounting, acceleration of reconciliation, and reduction of errors significantly increased the company's overall efficiency.
