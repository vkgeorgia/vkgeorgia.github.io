#### Why Industry Experience Isn't Always the Key

Many companies look for consultants who have deep experience in their specific industry. It's understandable — it feels safer to work with someone who already "speaks the language." However, the real value lies elsewhere in business consulting, especially in enterprise architecture.

I work with organizations across various industries — from energy and manufacturing to retail and IT. How is that possible? Because I rely on universal architectural methods and tools that allow me to:

**Abstract from industry specifics** and focus on goals, processes, and capabilities of the organization;

**Build a business model** that prioritizes structure, logic, and interconnections over sector-specific terminology.

**Objectively assess the current state** of your enterprise, whether you produce fuel or develop mobile apps.

**Offer solutions based on strategic goals**, not recycled patterns from within your industry.

Industry experience is helpful — no doubt about it. However, it can also be limiting if a consultant is stuck in the habits and assumptions of a particular niche. I bring a fresh perspective and a structured approach that works across sectors.

**My goal is not to copy what others are doing but to help your company find its own sustainable and effective path forward.**
