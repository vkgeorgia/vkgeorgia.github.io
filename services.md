I help companies transform and achieve their strategic goals by aligning business and IT through enterprise architecture, business analysis, and change planning. I work at the intersection of strategy, operations, and technology — combining systems thinking with practical experience.

## How I Help Businesses

I work with organisations that face strategic or operational challenges and need clarity on how to move forward.

**I conduct a structured assessment** of the enterprise to identify the root cause of the problem, not just the symptoms.

**I deliver a clear, actionable roadmap** that connects business goals with technology and shows exactly what to change and how.

**I solve business problems** using enterprise architecture, business analysis, and product strategy, ensuring that every solution is technically sound and strategically aligned.

## My Process

I often notice that companies have difficulty immediately understanding what an Enterprise Architect does and how this work helps their business. Let me explain in simple terms.

**1. Listen & Understand**

First, I listen to business representatives and understand their business problems or the challenges facing the company. I have extensive experience and a business education, so it's easy for me to speak the same language as companies.

**2. Analyze & Define**

Next, I distill the received materials into the current state of affairs and the desired outcome. It's essential to understand what we're striving for — where you are now and where you want to be.

**3. Design & Plan**

After that, using my experience and the latest technologies, I outline the steps necessary to achieve the goal. I try to solve business problems while accounting for existing resources and technological changes.

**4. Deliver Results**

As a result, the company receives a clear action plan, a roadmap for achieving its desired goals.

**In short: I solve business problems using technology.**
