## 🤝 How I Help Businesses

I work with organisations that face strategic or operational challenges and need clarity on how to move forward.

**I conduct a structured assessment** of the enterprise to identify the root cause of the problem, not just the symptoms.

**I deliver a clear, actionable roadmap** that connects business goals with technology and shows exactly what to change and how.

**I solve business problems** using enterprise architecture, business analysis, and product strategy, ensuring that every solution is technically sound and strategically aligned.
