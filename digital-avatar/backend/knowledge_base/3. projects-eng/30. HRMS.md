## Project: EPM-HRMS – Human Resource Management System (HRMS)

**Industry:** IT Services
**Domain:** Human Resources
**Employer:** EPAM
**Client:** EPAM
**Project Code:** EPM-HRMS
**Start Date:** Aug 2021
**End Date:** May 2022
**Role(s):** Enterprise Architect
**Key Result:** Requirements were gathered and technical specifications for an HR system were prepared, which led to improved efficiency, significant time savings, and compliance with data privacy regulations.

### Situation
EPAM Systems had a need to improve its internal human resources management system. The company was undergoing significant organizational changes due to the majority of employees transitioning to remote work and numerous relocations. The existing people-accounting systems were fragmented and outdated, making them inefficient for managing not only employees but also external contacts, students, and community members. This complicated data migration and jeopardized compliance with personal data legislation across the company's 58 countries of operation.

### Task
My task was to take on the part of the project related to people profile management and create the requirements for a new system. I needed to design a profile storage, establish its operational rules, account for dynamic data transformation, and ensure compliance with personal data legislation in various countries.

### Actions
I undertook the following actions over a period of 10 months (from August 2021 to May 2022):
* **Analysis of Current Processes:** I conducted numerous meetings with stakeholders from various departments to formalize the current people profile management processes and identify their pain points.
* **Requirements Identification and Formalization:** I identified the needs for future processes and, based on them, created a comprehensive set of functional and non-functional requirements for the new system.
* **Development of a Transformation Plan:** I developed a plan for transforming existing processes and integrating them with the new system.
* **Preparation of Technical Specifications:** I prepared detailed technical specifications based on the developed requirements and handed them over to the development teams for implementation.

### Result
As a result of my work:
* **Improved People Accounting System:** The company was able to improve its people accounting system (not just for employees), which increased the efficiency of various services, including HR, marketing, and the learning portal.
* **Labor Savings and Error Reduction:** The proposed changes led to savings of hundreds of man-hours per month and a significant reduction in accounting errors, which increased employee and client satisfaction and reduced the company's reputational risks.
* **Ensured Compliance with Legislation:** Full compliance with personal data processing legislation was ensured in the various countries where the company operates, eliminating legal risks.
* **Foundation for Future Growth:** The created documentation and transformation plan became the basis for further development and scaling of the system, allowing it to adapt to new organizational changes.
