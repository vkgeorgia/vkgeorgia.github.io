## Project: HR-BOT - AI-Driven Assistant for HR Service Automation

**Industry:** IT Services
**Domain:** Human Resources, AI Automation
**Employer:** EPAM Systems
**Client:** EPAM Systems
**Project Code:** HR-BOT
**Start Date:** 2024
**End Date:** Present
**Role(s):** Product Manager
**Key Result:** Deployed an AI-driven HR assistant that cut response times to minutes and automated most routine inquiries.

### Situation
EPAM Systems, with 68,000 employees, faced an overwhelming volume of routine HR inquiries across 12 key processes. Response times from human operators often stretched into several days, lowering employee satisfaction and limiting HR capacity for strategic work.

### Task
As Product Manager, my task was to design and implement an AI-powered chatbot to handle primary HR communication, minimize response times, automate standard inquiries, and integrate with the support ticket system for escalation to human experts when needed.

### Actions
During the first year of the ongoing project, I executed the following actions:
* **Team Leadership and Roadmap Planning:** Led a team of developers and business analysts, managed the product backlog, defined requirements, and planned long-term product development.
* **Technology Stack Orchestration:** Oversaw implementation using OpenAI LLM for NLP, Microsoft Semantic Kernel for AI orchestration, and C#, Kafka, and Cosmos DB for scalable data handling.
* **Interaction Logic Design:** Built a workflow where the bot resolves inquiries via a specialized knowledge base for 12 HR processes and escalates complex cases via automated ticket creation.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Established a feedback loop to monitor accuracy and refine the user experience based on data from the initial 35,000 active users.

### Result
As a result of the work to date:
* **Scalability:** The bot serves 35,000 employees (over 50% of the workforce) and is expanding to the full 68,000.
* **Dramatic Speed Improvement:** Response times dropped from several days to minutes.
* **High Automation Rate:** The bot resolves 80% of inquiries without human intervention.
* **Accuracy:** Responses reached 99% accuracy.
* **Business Impact:** The system saves thousands of man-hours per year, reducing operational load on HR and improving organizational efficiency.
